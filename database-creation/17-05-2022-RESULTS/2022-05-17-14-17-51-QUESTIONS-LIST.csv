1163874690,How to automate the Symantec VIP access code using cypress?,"### What would you like?

How can we automate the Symantec vip access code using cypress? For okta login we already have npm package as cypress-otp- https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress-otp. But for symantec vip how we are going to automate? I have gone thru this link but this is not accepting the credentials id for VIP access - https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/web-security#Form-Submission-Redirects. How cypress would get to know that this code is for my userid and password?

### Why is this needed?

899538735,Cy.intercept() doesn't catch request to GET png,"So I'm having problems calling cy.intercept() on a GET png file.

### What would you like?
<!-- A clear description of the feature or enhancement wanted in Cypress -->

Today I ran into an issue when I released a new version of my app to thousands of users. 

I added some new directories with php files into my app and all worked fine on my test machine. 

But, for some users the update broke their website. 

The reason was, that I named one folder with a capital letter like so `Example` instead of `example`.

My autoloader was working fine on my system because it is not capitalization sensitive. But other servers don't ignore capitalization and throw errors. 

Is there a way in Cypress to test all my file and folder structure for capitalization? 

If not, could you add this feature?

Thanks

When you set a method inside a object using another variable,
it seems that cy.wrap() will loose track of it.
But if you set a method inside the object itself,
cy.wrap will be able to call the method

but i believe that i should be able call methods inside objects as in both examples

};

// This object will throw undefined when trying to use its methods
let ObjectListError = {

// This object will work properly

// Comment
Note: The below code is not working because of variable undefined exception. As per my understanding, this is because of the way cypress runs its commands. 
In this example, I am waiting for my test data in before() block...but the line testDataList.forEach((...) executes before the 'before() {...}' block. 
As the variable testDataList will not be defined by that time, the exception is thrown. Please let me know if my understanding is incorrect or if there is an alternative to achieve the same task. 
FYI: I have tried the same code with beforeEach() block too.
// 
```js
let testDataList: string[]

            testType: ""testType"" // another query parameter required to retrieve test data from Dynamo DB

// Comment/Description
Note: This doesn't work as cypress commands cannot be called out of 'it' block. I have tried calling the task from a custom command but the same limitation exists. If my test data is available before the test I would have done something like [A,B,C].forEach(() => { it(..)})...but in my case A,B,C gets retrieved at runtime from cy.task.

731731434,I want to save an element text/value in a variable to use in assertions later.,"Hi,

I want to be able to save an element text before closing popup modal to use it in assertions in later steps.
using alias in the beforeEach block doesn't work because the element is not visible/accessible yet.
Also using invoke('text') or .text() or set the value as env value leave the variable undefined because of the async behavior.

here's my code
```js
    let formatText; 
    cy.get(projectsPage.projectFormatList).eq(projectFormatIndex).find('span').then(($formatElement) => {
            formatText = $formatElement.text();
OR
            formatText = $formatElement.invoke('text');
            cy.get($formatElement).click();
        })

//After modal close and doing some required steps
    cy.get(projectsPage.projectFormat).should('have.text', formatText);
```

717542431,Asserts and Errors not failing test within cy.route2,"
### Current behavior
I'm trying to get a download test to work. Am doing this by intercepting a graphql call (so the page load timeout issue does not occur) and while I am at it, I would like to verify stuff in the request. I found this page https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/smart-graphql-stubbing/ which is super helpful. However whenever I do an assert within the route handler function (and it fails) it does not fail the test. Sorry if this is already known about but the documentation in route2 seems to indicate that you can do assertions within there. To get around this I have to do .as('saveRequest') and then do cy.wait(). . .. several times until I hit the right request as there are lots of graphql calls going on which are only distinguishable by their operationName, once I find the one with the right operationName, then I can do the assertion I need to do in there.


### Desired behavior
As there are lots of graphql calls, it would be preferable to be able to do any required assertion within the route2 routeHandler instead.

### Test code to reproduce
```js
cy.route2(
        {
          method: 'POST',
          url: 'xxxxxxxx/graphql',
        },
        (req) => {
          const g = JSON.parse(req.body)
          if (g.operationName === 'xxxGraphqlOperationIWantToCheck') {
            expect(g.variables.someArray.length).to.equal(3); // Can see Cypress is failing this line, but the test is passing
            req.reply({
              body: {
                data: {},
              },
              headers: {

717304259,Feature Request: It would be nice to be able to change a variable in the middle on an it,"### Current behavior
At the moment you are not able to change variables in the middle of an it. `newTeamId` at `cy.url()` has the value `undefined`.

### Desired behavior

It would be nice if we had a command, something like ""cy.reloadVars"", so that we can make changes and check them any time during the test. When i do `cy.url()` i would like `newTeamId` to have the value that i get from the database, since i can't get it before the it beggins because the team is not created.

### Test code to reproduce
The scenario would be something like this:
```js
describe('create a team and check the url if it has the new team id', () => {
    let newTeamId: number;
    it('should create a team and check url', () => {
        cy.xpath('createTeamButton').click();
        // after creating the team, i make a request to the database to get the new team id and store it in newTeamId
        cy.url().should('contain', `/${newTeamId}`);
    })

Commands seem to be central to the Cypress development experience, but with commands being all in one namespace, there is an inherent concern with overusing them.

In documentation, there doesn't seem to be any guidance around the usage of commands, or what would warrant their usage over simply importing a defined function. It would be nice to get more guidance in this regard, as we don't want to have made a bad decision from the get-go on this matter.

689163854,Cypress navigates to a different URL cause of different pageObject vlaues.,"### Current behavior:

I have an chrome extension which will pick the page URL based on the window object of the current active tab. Extension is working as expected in normal usage, but when I try to execute the same with Cypress some of the internal network calls are failing and make the extension non functional. As per our RCA this is all happening cause Cypress navigates to a different URL, as its test run within an i frame with a specifically defined URL. These URLs do not match and thus cause an error when trying to retrieve data from the APIs. 

### Desired behavior:

Window object values should be same.

### Test code to reproduce
To reproduce the same,just fire the URL 'https://www.theglobeandmail.com/' and check the value of  window.location.pathname variable in normal manual test vs cypress tests.

// exclude these lines from code coverage
/* istanbul ignore next */
if (window.Cypress) {

 cy.route(
      ""GET"",
      "" http://www.mocky.io/v2/5eba1e742f000066953c3520"",
      ""@priceCheckData""
    );
```
So any clue how can I match my url with params? it can be dynamic params like 
```
https://staging.gobear.co/price?rate_id=*
https://staging.gobear.co/price?some_other_id=*
```
hence I can't simply use 
```
https://staging.gobear.co/price*
```

614723991,How to add all test run inside a test plan in test rail triggered from cypress,"We are using Cypress to automate UI test cases. We have recently integrated the cypress framework with test rail. It is able to create test run in test rail.

613967392,Can't overwrite multiple overloads of contains() command correctly,"<!-- Is this a question? Questions WILL BE CLOSED. Ask in our chat https://on.cypress.io/chat  -->

### Current behavior:
When I tried to overwrite two overloads of `.contains()` function only one of them works, another one seems to have misaligned arguments, thus it doesn't work properly.

Contains can work in two modes:
```js
cy.get('.foo').contains('bar', options)
```
and
```js
cy.contains('.foo', 'bar', options)
```

When I defined overwrite for one mode then everything worked fine, however, with override defined for both modes, only the second one is overridden.

<!-- A description including screenshots, stack traces, DEBUG logs, etc -->

### Desired behavior:

<!-- A clear description of what you want to happen -->

### Test code to reproduce

1. Create two overrides:
```js
// overwrites cy.get('.foo').contains('bar', options)
Cypress.Commands.overwrite('contains', (originalFn, subject, chars, options) => {
  return cy.log(options).then(() => originalFn(subject, chars, options));
});

// overwrites cy.contains('.foo', 'bar', options)
Cypress.Commands.overwrite('contains', (originalFn, subject, selector, chars, options) => {
  return cy.log(options).then(() => originalFn(subject, selector, chars, options));
});
```
2. Try to use both overrides in the test:
```js
cy.get('.foo').contains('bar', { some: 'option' });
cy.contains('bar', { some: 'option' });
```
3. Check Cypress log whether `{ some: 'option' }` has been logged for both usages

For such setup, only second .contains() usage will have options correctly logged, however, if we comment out second overwrite then the first one works correctly.

What I'm trying to achieve is to add support for one new option, `strict` (or `fullMatch`), which uses RegExp instead of partial match:

```js
Cypress.Commands.overwrite('contains', (originalFn, subject, chars, options) => {
  if (options && options.strict) {
    chars = new RegExp(`^${chars}$`);
  }

  return originalFn(subject, chars, options);
});
```

613364987,using styled-components or custom component with cypress,"Cypress selector is easy, just do `cy.get('.myComp')` and `<input className=""myComp"" />` will be selected but with styled-component

maybe we need to use custom attribute like cy-data, cy-testid etc. I guess there's no other shortcut than flood our component with those custom attribute right?

The other hassle using cypress is when you use css module, where the class is generated differently every build, and imagine your component is , then you need to pass your the custom attribute all the way down

I want to design my tests in such a way that all URL's and username and passwords are configured via the `cypress.json` file only. All URL's and values should be taken from the cypress.json value without the need for me to hard code them into the spec files.

prod.json, stag.json, and test.json

I can do that by plugins solution the do like this > npx cypress run --env configFile=prod

Cypress expnds the dropdown and clicks on the proper row in the list, though the row which should've been clicked does not save into the dropdown.

### Desired behavior:
Cypress should expand the dropdown and select the option 'Five', in my below example, as it did back in v3.4.1.

### Steps to reproduce: (app code and test code)
1. Pull repo from here: https://github.com/TheWanderingWalnut/cypressReactPortalDropdown

501794825,How to ensure all react components are loaded before cy.screenshot(),"### Current behavior: 

When trying to get screenshots of pages, even after waiting for all xhr requests and checking elements exist, `cy.screenshot()` will capture the page in an intermediate loading state where some things haven't rendered yet.

I do not want to use `cy.wait(1000)` as it is hacky and has caused my problems further down the test chain, such as random timeouts on screenshots.

### Desired behavior:

Is there any way to check a component has rendered and is visible before taking the screenshot?

### Steps to reproduce: (app code and test code)

Here is an example where it works when I add a wait but not without:
```js
cy.fixture(QA_FIXTURE).as('fixture');
  cy.server();
  cy.route('POST', '/v1.0/blobs/sign-url/').as('signUrl');

  cy.selectLatestActivity('/activity/');

  cy.get('@fixture').then(fixture => {
    if (fixture.BUILD_PREFIX === 'blah') {
      cy.log(fixture.BUILD_PREFIX);
      cy.wait('@signUrl').then(xhrs => {
        cy.wrap(xhrs.status).should('eq', 200);
      });
    }
  });
  cy.wait(2000);
  cy.screenshot();
  cy.get('[data-cy=""close_btn""]').click();
``` 

the signurl fucntion is the last request to occur, and even if use something like:
```js
cy.get('[data-cy=""close_btn""]').then(() => {cy.screenshot();});
```
To ensure the button is there after the request, it will still be a race to whether the component has rendered and the screenshot saved.

450907197,Cypress' cy.wait() does not wait on redirect,"### Current behavior:

I'm writing a test to cover our registration flow. 

On creating an account, user gets redirected to a `/registration` page where I then try to validate that a `send confirmation email` button exists. 

We have bunch of `GET` requests made on redirect on registration page, which causes a complete load of 'registration' page pretty long (I would say 5-7s?).

Of course, this caused the test became really 'flaky', so I decided to wait for those api routes to be resolved before proceeding to next commands, but it seems like the commands are getting executed and timing out before `cy.wait` gets resolved.

Custom command, wait for api: 

```js
Cypress.Commands.add('waitForApiResponse', function (url) {
    cy.server();
    cy.route('GET', '**/internal**/**').as('internalApi');
    cy.wait('@internalApi');
});
```

Actual test: 

```js
cy.get(vendorRegSelectors.vendorRegCreateButton).click();
cy.waitForApiResponse();

cy.location('pathname').should('eq', '/registration');
cy.get(vendorRegSelectors.sendConfirmEmailButton)
  .invoke('width')
  .should('be.gt', 0);
```

### Desired behavior:

Next commands of `cy.wait()` should not be executed until `cy.wait()` resolves successfully.

Now, I know that we can't wait FOREVER to grab requests that are being made within the app...

Would there really be a no other solution instead of increasing `timeout`?

442460180,Multiple 'it' in one 'describe' with a beforeEach,"### Can I have multiple 'it' in one describe' but also be running a beforeEach?

## Current behavior:
Currently, I am running a ```beforeEach``` and it resets at the beginning of each test which is what I want but also no. I have tests that are independent but grouped together because they are testing the same component. So, for now it looks like this: 
```js
describe('this is a test',function(){
	it('will be a test example',function(){
		cy.contains('test').click
		cy.contains('another test').click()
	})
})
```

```js
beforeEach(() => {
  cy.visit('http://localhost:3000/');

432012188,data-react-beautiful-dnd-draggable does not work with cypress drag and drop command,"Hi,

I have been trying to understand why the mouse/keyboard cypress commands don't work with the 'data-react-beautiful-dnd-draggable' in react for a web application we have developed. I am running the cypress tests on Chrome on an element of type 'form'.

I am attempting to drag and drop a series of text boxes by swapping them with each other. These text boxes can be identified using 'form id=X'. The text boxes also have a 'data-position' attribute. On drag and drop these text boxes should fire an API call that gets the text boxes reordered but so far had no luck actually moving the textboxes around.

I have tried the following approaches:
- dnd plugin 
- following the cypress dnd recipe
- using keyboard actions such as keyDown/keyUp
- using dragstart,dragend,mouseover,mousedown

This is a snippet of the code I was running:
Keyboard actions:

```javascript
describe(""Reorder text boxes"", () => {
    it(""should reorder textboxes"", function() {
      cy.wait(2000);
      cy.get(""div[class*=index_banner]:nth-child(2)"")
        .focus()
        .trigger(""space"", { keyCode: space, force: true })
        .trigger(""keyup"", { keyCode: arrowUp, force: true })
        .wait(5000)
        .trigger(""space"", { keyCode: space, force: true });
      });
  });
```


Mouse actions:
```javascript
              cy.get(`form[id=309]`)
              .parent() // locates dnd-react component
              .focus()           
              .trigger('mousedown', { clientX: 338 , clientY: 268 })              
              .trigger('mousemove', { clientX: 338 , clientY: 262 })
              wait(3000)
              .trigger('mouseout', { clientX: 339 , clientY: 258 })
              .trigger('mouseleave', { clientX: 339 , clientY: 258 })

428972976,logged-in state is lost after test causes another POST request,"I'm confused here. I have this very simple test that logs my user in, then visits a page that requires the user to be logged in, views a form and clicks the submit button

```js
describe('Logs In and Submits Form', () => {
  it('Mocks Login', () => {
    cy.mockLoginAndGoto('form');
  });

  it('Sees Form', () => {
    cy.get('form', {
      timeout: 5000,
    }).should('be.visible');
  });

  it('Clicks Submit Button', () => {
    cy.get('[data-cy=""submit-button""]').click();
  });
});
```

The login part uses JWT, anyway that part works fine. It then visits the route `/form` and views the form element. This form is only visible to logged-in users, I can clearly see that at this point the user is logged in, I can see that from the UI showing the user's name. So far so good. Then in the last step, a button is clicked which triggers a `POST` requests, which passes the authorization token retrieved from the first step.

This part fails because for some reason I can't figure out, by the time it reaches the 3rd step, the user is no longer logged in, and as such the authorization token is not included with the `POST` request.

This ""flow"" works fine if you run it manually.

Now, if I run all 3 steps as a single `it()`, then it works correctly

```js
describe('Logs In and Submits Form', () => {
  it('Mocks Login, sees form, clicks submit button', () => {
    cy.mockLoginAndGoto('form');

    cy.get('form', {
      timeout: 5000,
    }).should('be.visible');

    cy.get('[data-cy=""submit-button""]').click();
  });
});
```

This works correctly. How come? What am I missing?

This is a simplified version of the real test. The real test involves logging in, testing a bunch of steps then at the end clicking the submit button and submitting a form that's been filled out by the previous steps. I don't want to have to mock the login before each of those steps. I also don't want to have to eliminate all my steps and run 20 sets of directives as a single `it()`.

Why is it that all steps keep my user logged in but when I reach the step that causes a `POST` request, only then does it fail and reverts my state to logged-out? But as a single `it()` it works?

The command that returned the promise was:

  > cy.type()

The cy command you invoked inside the promise was:

  > cy.rerender()

Because Cypress commands are already promise-like, you don't need to wrap them or return your own promise.

Cypress will resolve your command with whatever the final Cypress command yields.

The reason this is an error instead of a warning is because Cypress internally queues commands serially whereas Promises execute as soon as they are invoked. Attempting to reconcile this would prevent Cypress from ever resolving.

422568450,"cy.get(el).should('match', regex) fails to compare regex against el's innnerText","### Current behavior:

I'm not using the middle `contains` in my tests & I'll use a more interesting regex to check something else. But, for a simple failing case, see:

The above line of my e2e tests fails with the following output:

It looks like the `contains` yielded `<span class=​""MuiButton-label-214"">​Next​</span>​` But then the match assertion is only checking `<span class=​""MuiButton-label-214"">​` and not the inner text.

I don't see anything in the [assertion reference](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/assertions.html) that suggests `match` should only be comparing against the element name & classes.

### Desired behavior:

`cy.get(element).should('match', regex)` should compare the regex against the element's inner text too, not just the element name & classes.

Alternatively, I'd like to have some way to assert that some element in an array has an inner text that matches some regex. See issue #3746 for another unsuccessful attempt I made at solving this problem.

Maybe ""should"" should wait instead but that fails to find the element as well because page was not fully loaded and/or ""should"" did not wait and/or default timeout for ""should"" was too short?

from the docs
```
When you load your application using cy.visit(), Cypress will wait for the load event
to fire. It is really this easy. The cy.visit() command loads a remote page and does 
not resolve until all of the external resources complete their loading phase.

409466652,Cypress cannot handle d3 drag events,"### Current behavior:
When I write a test in cypress that performs a drag event on a canvas that has drag event listeners attached from d3, test fail. In the cypress UI, the canvas looks blank (it looks as expected if I am not testing events on the canvas ), the click events seem to register but the actions do not occur.  

### Desired behavior:

When I write a test with drag events on a D3 canvas, I expect the app will act the same as if I had manually performed a drag event. 

### Steps to reproduce: (app code and test code)

I created a test case: https://github.com/csweaver/cypress-test-tiny (master branch)

Right now I'm doing a proof of concept to see if Cypress is the right choice for our project and we are using React Virtualized to display a list of elements.

When I try to use `scrollTo()` on the React Virtualized container, I get this error:
```
CypressError: Timed out retrying: cy.scrollTo() failed because this element is not scrollable:

<div class=""ReactVirtualized__Grid__innerScrollContainer"" role=""rowgroup"" style=""width: auto; height: 3960px; max-width: 820px; max-height: 3960px; overflow: hidden; position: relative;"">...</div>

I've read in this thread: https://github.com/applitools/eyes.cypress/issues/9 that Cypress falls short on elements which scroll internally.

I've set `window.onkeydown` in my web page.

I am in a cypress test and want to access and run it (because `cy.type()` does not simulate a key down event in this way).

I call `cy.window.then((w) => w.onkeydown({key: ""c""}) ) `

Upon some brief investigation, it turns out that:

- `w.onkeydown` is `null`
- When I run `console.log(w)` it shows that `w.onkeydown` is not `null`, and in fact is the function I am expecting it to be, according to the `[[FunctionLocation]]` metadata.

So the function I want to invoke is accessible from where I am, but is not being mapped over to the actual returned value of `cy.window()` I suppose.

388194456,compare two aliases which derive value from two different contexts.,"I have a two containers inside a section.
Both hit different end points to derive some a values, post that they compare these values and decide either to render. (thats how the app works).

387652838,Is the test order within one file (one describe block) guaranteed?,"So this may not even be a Cypress specific thing but since I'm using Cypress I still think it's bes to ask here.

I'ts a very simply question:

_Is the test order within one file (one describe block) guaranteed?_

Why do I ask that?

We have quite a lot of database dependent tests.
Because of this we often have to seed our database data within tests.

Now let's assume I have the following tests:

```js
describe('My database tests', () => {
  // this is only done once for all tests in this block
  before(() => {
    seedUsersInDatabase();
  });

  it('Get users', () => {
    // expect 10 users
   });

  it('Remove users', () => {
    // expect 5 users removed
   });
});
```
Maybe you already see why the question poppep up.

If it's guaranteed that the tests within a `describe` block are always executed in the same order, I can seed the database with `before`. However if the order is not guaranteed I'd need to change it to `beforeEach`.

I personally assumed the order is guaranteed and therefore wrote only the `before`. The main reason for this is by the way: _Performance_! Seeding a database sometimes takes quite the time (even if it's just 100ms, it sums up if you have a lot of tests).",question

362278952,API latency issue causes tests fail,"Not sure if cypress has the feature or not.

I am writing an integration test right now. And the tests use `post` API call in `before()` function. The API call is used to create a person. In test, I will use the person created in `before()` function. However, I can't search out this person sometimes because of API latency. In other words, the person's name is not in searching result page. Before using cypress, I was using a while loop and checked whether the searching page had the name. If not, it reloaded the page in the while loop until it found the name. But I don't think I can do it in cypress. I tried to use `cy.get('table').should($t => {do something(like reload) })`, but it didn't work since `$t` won't change after reload so I am stuck for this problem.

I have some tests that look like this. The point is that after submitting a form app redirect to other page with other requests that I wouldn't like to stub. That's why I don't use .then() construction and would like to finish tests before I get a response (even stubbed). Currently this test shows failed assertion but it's difficult to notice because test looks to be passed successfully.

Calling `cy.server()` and `cy.route()` inside an `it()`, without calling `cy.visit()`.
This makes Cypress not track and XHR events and makes `cy.route()` useless.

### Desired behavior:
If I already am on the correct page from a previous test, then a new test should track XHR requests if I call `cy.server()` and `cy.route()`.

### Steps to reproduce:
```ts
it(""test1, () => {
	cy.server();
    cy.route(""POST"", ""**"").as(""postR"");
    cy.visit(""index/admin/status-settings""); //A new page in my Angular app

})

it(""test2, () => {
	cy.server();
    cy.route(""POST"", ""**"").as(""postR"");
	// this does NOT tracks XHR reqests before I call cy.visit() again to refresh the page.
	// So if I call cy.wait(""@postR"") it will never complete,

348228788,Discussion: e2e testing,"We have an ios and android app and we are currently building a progressive web app for it. 

For testing the app we use Detox (https://github.com/wix/detox) for our e2e tests and I’m currently evaluating frameworks for e2e tests for our web app. Cypress looks cool, but I have some issues with the concept. 

In this video https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5XQOK0v_YRE @brian-mann says that tests should run independently. One should thoroughly test the login and then for everything else mock a logged in user. The first definition of e2e test that comes online when searching in google is from techopedia:
https://www.techopedia.com/definition/7035/end-to-end-test

> Definition - What does End-to-End Test mean?
> 
> End-to-end testing is a methodology used to test whether the flow of an application is performing as designed from start to finish. The purpose of carrying out end-to-end tests is to identify system dependencies and to ensure that the right information is passed between various system components and systems.
> Techopedia explains End-to-End Test
> 
> End-to-end testing involves ensuring that the integrated components of an application function as expected. The entire application is tested in a real-world scenario such as communicating with the database, network, hardware and other applications. 
> 
> For example, a simplified end-to-end testing of an email application might involve:
> Logging in to the application
> Accessing the inbox
> Opening and closing the mailbox
> Composing, forwarding or replying to email
> Checking the sent items
> Logging out of the application

The first sentence reads “to test whether the flow of an application is performing as designed from start to finish”. With e2e tests we are talking about a flow, which is different from unit tests where we testing different units in isolation. 

With detox I’m able to simulate the flow of interaction with our app. The user logs in, then he is able to perform different actions one after another. 

After loging in the user creates an article, then he comments on the article etc. The user is not able to comment without first creating an article. There is no point of executing a comment test before creating an article. There is also no point of always logging in the user before each test. Nobody in real life logs in before every action. I understand the reasoning of starting with clear state for each test, but this goes against the way users acutally interact with our applications. There are situations in which the user enters an url directly, but in 99.99% of the time we navigate from page to page by clicking on buttons on the site. The user follows a pattern that the developer has created for him. 

Is it possible for cypress to execute tests one after the other without refreshing the state and without actully starting a new browser instance. I would like to create a suite of tests that need to execute in particular order one after the other.

When `beforeEach` fails in one test it stops the execution of all the tests after that.

### Desired behavior:

Is it possible to add an option to make the run keep going even if `beforeEach` fails once?
In my case I'm using `beforeEach` to log in into my application, but sometimes from clicking the ""Log in"" button until the page has loaded a lot of time passes and the `beforeEach` fails.

However, it's not like the application is failing, it's just taking a long time to load the page.

This is my code:
```js
beforeEach(function () {
        cy.visit('')

        cy.url()
            .should('contain','login')

```

My problem is that `cy.get(""#btnLogin"").click({timeout:10000})` takes a long time to load the page, and then `cy.url().should('include','/app/list')` fails because even if sometimes the page has loaded, it is still reading the old url and not the new one. I will give an example:

This sometimes fails even if the page has loaded because the `cy.url()` is reading the old url and not the new page one.

Because of this I have two questions:
1) As I asked before, is it possible to add an option to beforeEach so it keeps running the tests even if it has failed once?
2) Is there a way to make `cy.url()` read the new page and not the old one?",question

333088394,Testing the tests.,"This is neither an issue nor a feature request, as I am quite satisfied with the atomic patterns with which I can control the way that Cypress runs and how I can step through the tests when they fail, but I am working on the generational production of a large battery of tests based on generic types hydrated from a resource that also scaffolds the vuex store, localstorage and vue (using Quasar). 

My components and logic are all unit tested, I am using the electron version of vue-devtools to watch state and events, I personally test critical external modules and cypress guarantees that vuex and vue collaborate properly during runtime - but... 

My tests are generational and only exist in memory during the run - so how can I test my tests to make sure that they (or more rather the code itself) has 100% coverage? 

Does anyone have any experience in this admittedly silly exercise or recommendations about similar work? I have thought about wrapping the cypress tests in [tap](https://github.com/tapjs/node-tap), but I am pretty sure that cypress won't really like that double-bootstrapping. I also thought about using cy.exec() in each step, but cy.task() almost seems more appropriate. Anyway, I would totally appreciate any ideas or pointers here...",question
333056005,General App Setup,"### Current behavior:
We have an initial localization (using [i18-react](https://github.com/alexdrel/i18n-react)) setup once our app loads:

```js
import { defaultLanguage, setLanguage } from ""../../src/i18n"";

setLanguage(defaultLanguage);
```

i18n.js file:

```js
import T from 'i18n-react';


let currentLang = '';
export const defaultLanguage = 'en';


const languages = {
  'en': require('../locale/en.json')
};


/**
 * @param {string} lang Language
 */
export function setLanguage(lang) {
  if (!(lang in languages)) {
    lang = defaultLanguage;
  }
  currentLang = lang;
  T.setTexts(Object.assign({}, languages[defaultLanguage], languages[lang]));
}
```

We run this once when our app loads, and we thought of placing this under `support/index.js`. Not sure if that's the proper spot. In any case, our string comparison fails when we try to use the `T.translate` function. It turns out our `T` object in our spec files is now a different `T` object than the one we used to setLanguage on, which makes it impossible for us to test for strings. 
Our current workaround is to place the `setLanguage` function at the top of each spec file, but we obviously want to stop doing that.

What are we doing wrong? Is there a better place to have this function run?

### Desired behavior:
`T` object is the same singleton shared across the entire test cycle, just like in the real application.

### Steps to reproduce:
I guess you can just install the `i18n-react` package and use the code above. Then you can see that `T.translate(STRING_KEY)` never finds its translation since the `this.texts` property in `T` is always null since the `T` object is a different one.

I use Turbolinks in my application. If I click on two links after each other, where the link is present on both pages like a ""Next"" link, I get ""xhr aborted"" and it fails.
It seems as cypress clicks the same link twice (not waiting for the xhr to finish)...
If I add a `cy.wait(0)` between the clicks it seems to work. But it's a bit of a hack :)

### Desired behavior:

It should wait for the next page and click the correct link.

### Steps to reproduce:

Create a page with Turbolinks which links to another page (like a ""Next"" link in a pagination).
On this other page, add the same link to a ""Next"" page.

Now, run a Cypress test where you click on the ""Next"" link twice. This will fail (might be a bit random).

Adding `cy.wait(0)` between the clicks seem to solve the problem for some reason.

Feature. The FAQ says it'll work with a little extra code and I looked through the cypress specs you guys use for testing the cypress electron browser, but I did not see any stubbing node methods. ie fs methods etc. 

This may be a feature request for enhanced docs. Nobody in the chat responded to this question. I've asked three times on gitter now so I gave my best to not file a bug for this question.

I've found https://github.com/cypress-io/env-or-json-file/blob/ef205312ba73f2fd6404947005b1a401cb6dd305/src/env-or-json-file-spec.js#L43 which looks promising but I don't think these specs are ran using Cypress? Regardless I tried to copy what was done in this spec without success.

And the FAQ points to https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/tree/develop/packages/desktop-gui/cypress/integration but I don't see any node methods being stubbed. Am I just missing it?

### Current behavior:

Stubbing like this doesn't work.
```js
const fs = require('fs');
it('does something', () => {
  cy.stub(fs, 'readFileSync').returns('file contents'); // Errors: fs does not have method 'readFileSync'

    // We wait on our previously tagged request and then verify that the file exists on S3 !
    cy.wait('@uploadPut').then(resp => {

      s3.headObject(params).promise()

Promises are behaving very strangely inside cy.wait() and I didn't find any problem similar to mine. I'm just trying to make the test fail gracefully with a good error message. The only workaround I found was to return the call to s3.headObject(params).promise(). That will make the test fail but the error message is really bad.

When using `npx cypress open` and then selecting my spec the AJAX request sends every time without any issues.

However if I run my tests using `npx cypress run` on my CircleCI job the AJAX request is very flakey. Sometimes it sends and sometimes it doesn't. I'm guessing this is because the test runner is killing the spec before the AJAX request can be sent.

### Desired behavior:

I'd like to know how we can stop the spec from being killed until the request has been successfully sent. I've already tried using `cy.wait` but this doesn't work.

Is there a way that I can manually fail a test in the promise on my AJAX request?

### Steps to reproduce:

Run an AJAX request inside of `Cypress.on('fail')` and then use the `npx cypress run` command. Alternatively any logic that can take a bit of time within here such as a `setTimeout` can't be ran.

For example go to the website https://openlayers.org/en/latest/examples/draw-features.html. Select here by Geometry type for point to click on the map or polygon to draw a polygon on the map. It has to be possible to get this in my test right?

**So the tests what I want to do is like:**

**Test 01:**
1. Go to https://openlayers.org/en/latest/examples/draw-features.html
2. Choose Geometry type ""point""
3. Click on map

**Test 02:**
1. Go to https://openlayers.org/en/latest/examples/draw-features.html
2. Choose Geometry type ""polygon""
3. Draw a polygon on the map

ps: I always updated my cypress version, so got the last one now. Trying to test this on a mac and windows.

313431211,Feature: Access browser extensions API/storage/messaging,"I use Cypress to test a browser extension (hat tip for #1078 btw) that stores its settings in the [extension local storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/storage/local).

So I need to clear the extension local storage between each test, and possibly setup fixtures in there, but there doesn't seem to be any built-in way with Cypress.

Because it has a content script, I can hack a workaround with `window.postMessage(clearDbMessage, ""*"")`, catch it in the content script that relays it to the background tab (with `runtime.sendMessage`), that can then clear the DB (or setup fixtures). But it's less than ideal because 1. It's hard to make it unexploitable by the pages users will visit and 2. It's a lot of boilerplate testing-specific code to add to my codebase.

Feature.

### Current behavior:
Currently the only way I can figure out to generate user login data with faker for each run and share it amongst  all the tests in that run is to stuff it into the environment variables. This is fine apart from in development when I want to do iterative runs with fresh data.
Currently to get the plugin to run again and populate the environment vars with fresh data I have to stop and start Cypress.

### Desired behavior:
Maybe a reboot button on the UI.
Or a hook to inject environment variables into the config before each run.
Or a mechanism to share data between all your tests in a run other than stuffing the env object.

This is a **Bug** (at least I think).

### Current behavior:

I fail the login voluntarily because I need to try the redirect to `/login` path.

But instead I got this strange behaviour:

- `cy.visit(""/dashboard"")` takes me to `/dashboard`;
- my website **redirects** the browser to `/login` path;
- `cy.location(""pathname"").should(""eq"", ""/dashboard"")` is OK for Cypress;
- `cy.location(""pathname"").should(""not.eq"", ""/login"")` is OK for Cypress;
- after all this he says in test runner: ""_(NEW URL) http://localhost:8080/login_""

I expected a different flow. Because I thought Cypress waited for the redirect. But it doesn't. **Why?**

Feature

launching Cypress globally (after installing via `npm i -g cypress` and launching with `cypress open`) always takes you to the ""select a folder"" screen.

cypress opens in the current directory (finds the tests in `./cypress/integrations`)

The easy way out would be to just plaster my markup with `id=""e2e-blabla""` but that doesn't feel particularly nice to be honest.

Another way could be to look for partial matches in class names. For example the CSS Modules class `.form` produces the actual class name `.styles__form--3gcRC` in the DOM. One could now use a CSS attr selector such as `[class*=form]` which would work in many case but can lead to name conflicts and kinda removed all the benefits of having locally scoped and unique class names.

279568997,Retrieve full URL from XHR entry in test runner,"### Is this a Feature or Bug?

FEATURE

### Current behavior:

In the test runner view, I see that a bunch of XHR requests have been made, but I can't see the full URL. Tried expanding the size of that pane, hovering over each item, clicking, right-clicking, but can't find a way to get the full URL.

### Desired behavior:

It would be great to be able to somehow get the full URL from these XHR lines, to visually confirm the order of events and to make it quick to set up cy.route(). Although I can open the Network tab of dev tools, there is a lot of activity going on there and no way to match it to the XHR entries in the test runner view. The test runner view is a better representation of the calls as they relate to the tests, and would be the ideal place to get these URLs from.

  Cypress.Cookies.defaults({
    whitelist: /SESSION_COOKIE/
  });

  before('we should log in first', () => {
    cy
      // clearCookies() does not clear whitelisted cookies
      .clearCookies()
      .visit('application_url, which sets a NEW SESSION_COOKIE to use throughout the following tests');
  });

  it('should still have SESSION_COOKIE', function() {
    cy
      .visit('application_url/subpage')
      .wait(5000); 

      // .wait() was just added so you can inspect the list of cookies.
      // Notice that SESSION_COOKIE stays the same over several runs.
  });

  it('should really still have SESSION_COOKIE', function() {
    // More tests.
    cy
      .visit('application_url/subpage')
      .wait(5000);
  });

  it('should really really still have SESSION_COOKIE', function() {
    // More and more tests.
    cy
      .visit('application_url/subpage')
      .wait(5000);
  });
});
```

In the current phase my tests keeps failing, because the first run logs in and because I preserve the cookie, it is persisted throughout every test that runs.

Technically I'm not able to clear cookies between runs/during tests.


### Desired behavior:
Few suggestions :)
- clearCookies() should be able to remove all cookies, even whitelisted cookies (to avoid a breaking change, it can be an option to clearCookies(), e.g. clearWhitelisted: true ?)
- Next to 'preserveOnce()' I'd also rather see a 'preserve' that will at least preserve the cookies throughout the test suite (test suite = 1 file). If I want to achieve what I actually want right now I have to call preserveOnce() in every single test.

### How to reproduce:
Use the above code, start coding on the test and press Save. Cypress will run the test, but preserve the whitelisted cookie even though it says 'clearCookies()'. Also when you use the 'Run all tests'. 

#### Test code:
See above :)

When running on a machine that requires a corporate proxy, cypress does not use the proxy settings and therefore cannot access and run tests on pages behind the proxy.

### Desired behavior:
Cypress should respect the internal proxy settings of the network. From Brian Mann in Gitter:

179132244,Potentially catch global `onunhandledrejection` as errors?,"Currently Cypress taps into `window.onerror` for failing tests which have script errors.

But we don't tap into `onunhandledrejection` events. I believe we should, but enable this to be configurable.

**API Idea:**

```
Cypress.Errors.listenForUncaughtExceptions(false)
```

```
Cypress.Errors.listenForUnhandledRejections(false)
```

146881812,Check for background traffic,"Is there a way to monitor and check background traffic?

For example if I enter a site and that site is supposed to issue a tracking call back to the server that does not change the UI - can I somehow check if that tracking call contained a specific string in its url?

115899829,.not() command performs differently from :not() selector,"I am trying to chain the `.not()` command off of a subject with 2 elements. One of the elements will be removed from the DOM (my expected behavior). I wanted to ensure that the remaining element did not have class `empty`. An error throws on the `.not` command due to the first element being removed and the `.not` command is never run on the second element. 

**Example Code I want to write**

``` coffeescript
    it ""adds row on click of link in empty [1yo]"", ->
      cy
        .get(""[data-js='destroy-selection']:first"").click()
        .get("".empty"").find(""[data-js='new-selection-empty']"").click()
        .get("".selections-table>tbody>tr"") ## returns 2 trs
          .not("".empty"").should(""have.length"", 1) ## want to target tr without class .empty
```

**Command Log Result**

If I change my code to use a `:not()` selector, the desired behavior results. This is the behavior I was expecting with the `.not` command. 

**Code with `:not` selector**

``` coffeescript
    it ""adds row on click of link in empty [1yo]"", ->
      cy
        .get(""[data-js='destroy-selection']:first"").click()
        .get("".empty"").find(""[data-js='new-selection-empty']"").click()
        .get("".selections-table>tbody>tr:not(.empty)"") ## returns 1 tr
            .should(""have.length"", 1)
```

Am I just improperly using `.not()` or is this unexpected behavior of Cypress?

64832186,allow for aliasing of things beside DOM elements,"I'd like to be able to alias things other than DOM elements, for example a url string of a request. example:

``` js
describe ""asset search"", ->
  beforeEach ->
   cy
     .route(/assets/, {}).as(""getAssets"")
     .get(""form"").submit()
     .wait(""@getAssets"").its(""url"").as(""requestUrl"")

   it ""does not search areaId"", ->
     cy.get(""@requestUrl"").should(""not.match"", /areaId/)

   it ""does not search locationId"", ->
     cy.get(""@requestUrl"").should(""not.match"", /locationId/)

This currently just says `Syntax error, unrecognized expression: @requestUrl`
