1233200231,Multiple zombie processes when running Cypress inside the Docker with Node,"### Current behavior

When running Cypress tests in an infinite loop inside a docker container and starting the test script with `node cypress.js`, we can see a huge amount of zombie (`<defunct>`) processes. 
When starting the same cypress-test.js file inside the docker container by using a shell script - all child processes are killed correctly, so no zombies are left.
Due to this bug, it is impossible to run cypress tests using 'pm2' or 'node' inside a docker container. At one point all processes just stop, because no free PID is left, so no new process can be started.

Tested with Cypress Version: 7.7.0, 9.6.1

No <defunct> zombie processes should appear, when running cypress tests synchronously inside a docker container by using `ENTRYPOINT [ ""node"", ""./cypress-test.js"" ]`

1231537453,Tests finish without running all commands if Error is not a constructor,"### Current behavior

I have noticed this rare but unfortunate behavior, same was noticed by other people on my team.
Sometimes a test passes, but when you look at it, it is missing lots of commands, as if it exited early. 
For example the test below should have a lot more commands, yet it has finished already somehow

<img width=""845"" alt=""err1"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2212006/167695885-90111c2c-f905-47dc-a745-50cc0b060b1c.png"">

When poking around, I noticed the Devtools is showing an error that is NOT reflected in the Command Log ""ErrorConstructor is not a constructor"" Seems somehow the `specWidow.Error` can be undefined, which causes a problem when we grab the user stack

<img width=""602"" alt=""err2"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2212006/167696220-8df54c74-3cf1-4e2b-a579-6888b40b536f.png"">

The error can be thrown only inside

```js
const captureUserInvocationStack = (ErrorConstructor, userInvocationStack) => {
  if (!userInvocationStack) {
    const newErr = new ErrorConstructor('userInvocationStack');
    userInvocationStack = newErr.stack; // if browser natively supports Error.captureStackTrace, use it (chrome) (must be bound)
    // otherwise use our polyfill on top.Error

    const captureStackTrace = ErrorConstructor.captureStackTrace ? ErrorConstructor.captureStackTrace.bind(ErrorConstructor) : Error.captureStackTrace;
    captureStackTrace(newErr, captureUserInvocationStack); // On Chrome 99+, captureStackTrace strips away the whole stack,
    // leaving nothing beyond the error message. If we get back a single line
    // (just the error message with no stack trace), then use the original value
    // instead of the trimmed one.

    if (newErr.stack.match('\n')) {
      userInvocationStack = newErr.stack;
    }
  }

  userInvocationStack = normalizedUserInvocationStack(userInvocationStack);
  return userInvocationStack;
};
```

Which receives the `ErrorConstructor` from its callers, but does not check if it is defined or a function before calling `new ...`

A few more places from the stack that call this function
<img width=""1070"" alt=""err3"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2212006/167696488-1b69d3a5-c862-4a23-b68a-d37dc17de6c3.png"">

A conditional breakpoint worked to stop there on undefined `Error` argument
<img width=""756"" alt=""err5"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2212006/167696596-5a6dce05-b9ee-4a19-a7c0-27e5d1754375.png"">

### Desired behavior

This is very rare but happens and is very concerning. Especially since it lowers the confidence in the passing tests. 
What I would like to do is a simple guard: if there is no `ErrorConstructor`, do not try to use it. Having no stack is preferred to skipping the rest of the test with PASS status.

### Test code to reproduce

Really don't know, since this function is called a lot at the start of the test. 
I will try to trace it better, but a little defensive programming would not hurt still

1229253532,Support for multiple browsers in one run,"### What would you like?

I would like to configure Cypress like this:

`cypress run --browsers chrome,firefox`

This would
- run the test suite in both browsers.
- It would not stop if one of those fail
- it would report test results and videos/screenshots for both of them, prefixed with the browser / in a sub directory with the name of the browser

### Why is this needed?

We run Cypress in a cypress docker container to run the tests by Ops on other systems and mount the test results on the hosts file system. I've spent considerable amount of time to do this properly to run Cypress twice and have all test reports properly available on the host.

It would be a lot easier, if cypress would support that out of the box. And I could assume that this is actually a valid use case to run a suite with different browsers

1228736626,Some elements are not loaded while running page in chrome via cypress,"### Current behavior

Hi, after running ""npx cypress open"" the image and ""bag"" icon(web element) cannot be loaded when page is opened in Chrome. Actually, it seems that the website behaves differently, like that some actions doesn't work. For example adding to bag functionality behaves very strange on my web shop site. However, if I visit the same page on Chrome manually without Cypress everything loads very fast.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105131708/167273244-f2d658b4-f046-4331-b802-c6ebd821fa74.png)

These are the errors I see in the console. Maybe it is something that has to do with this:

Failed to load resource: net::ERR_SSL_SERVER_CERT_BAD_FORMAT

Test failed at step  cy.get('#divBagItems').should('be.visible')  because bag popup should appear but it seems that nothing happened after clicking to ""add to bag"" button. Actually, the application behaves differently when I run it via Cypress.

1228225945,Styles dont render in pinned DOM snapshots when running in GUI mode with CSP enabled,"### Current behavior

When running cypress tests in GUI mode against a page with a content-security-policy (csp) such as
```
<meta http-equiv=""Content-Security-Policy"" content=""default-src 'self';"">
```

The tests appear to run fine, and the html page loads correctly with all the correct styling. However, you do see csp violations if you have the console open, and if you try to hover/pin a DOM snapshot from the cypress GUI test panel, those snapshots fail to load styles due to a csp violation ""trying to apply inline style"" for `cypress_runner.js`. See repro https://github.com/darrinmn9/cypress-example-recipes/pull/1 for screenshots of issue.


### Desired behavior

From my understanding of reading related csp issues, I believe cypress strips the csp meta tag before running tests since currently there is no support for running them with csp enabled. but I do still see this csp `<meta>` tag inside the `iframe` of my mounted html page in the cypress GUI. (correct me if im wrong here)

The desired behavior is that pinned DOM screenshots would work and render styles correctly, just like the main page in the test GUI does. Ideally you shouldnt see any csp errors in the console output.

1227734969,Make it possible to configure `nodeIntegration` and other web preferences when testing React components in Electron browser,"### What would you like?

I am trying to configure `nodeIntegration` and other web preferences for the Electron browser using the `before:browser:launch` hook. As mentioned [here](https://docs.cypress.io/api/plugins/browser-launch-api#Changing-browser-preferences) in the Cypress documentation, `launchOptions.preferences` should be the `BrowserWindow` `options` object.

This is an extract of my **cypress/plugins/index.js**:

```js
module.exports = (on, config) => {
  if (config.testingType === 'component') {

    on('before:browser:launch', (browser = {}, launchOptions) => {
      if (browser.name === 'electron') {
        launchOptions.preferences.webPreferences.nodeIntegration = true;
        launchOptions.preferences.webPreferences.contextIsolation = false;
        launchOptions.preferences.webPreferences.enableRemoteModule = true;
      }
      return launchOptions;
    });

    // ...
  }
}
```

However, this configuration does not seem to be taken into account, and I am still getting problems with `global`, `require`, `path`, `fs`, etc. not being available in the renderer process of the Electron browser.

### Why is this needed?

I am trying to leverage the recent support for React component testing in order to test the React components of an existing Electron application.

### Other

When I run my component test, I immediately get an error from Cypress. It looks like `Cypress` is undefined when invoking `Cypress.emit(event, ...args)`.

When I select my test in the left menu, I get another error: `Uncaught ReferenceError: global is not defined`.

1227676986,Cypress Studio: give data-testid priority when picking up a selector for recorded interaction,"### What would you like?

Cypress Studio is an awesome feature, however it frequently picks less than optimal selector for the any particular step. Consider DOM structure like the following:

```html
<button type=""button"" aria-label=""Add New"" data-testid=""Button::Add New"">
  <span class=""style_label__O3pAy"">
    <div class=""c-h-flex"">
      <i class=""Icon_icon__R1RDX Icon_small__Q8FfZ style_pageControlIcon__3kvpN style_pageControlIconLoading__P+QzK"">
        <svg xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" fill=""currentColor"" viewBox=""0 0 24 24"">
          <path fill-rule=""evenodd"" d=""M12 4c-.78 0-1.412.632-1.412 1.412v5.176H5.412a1.412 1.412 0 000 2.824h5.176v5.176a1.412 1.412 0 002.824 0v-5.176h5.176a1.412 1.412 0 000-2.824h-5.176V5.412C13.412 4.632 12.78 4 12 4z"" clip-rule=""evenodd""></path>
        </svg>
      </i>
      <p aria-hidden=""true"" class=""copy-5 style_pageControlLabel__TsIAb"">Add New</p>
    </div>
  </span>
</button>
```

As you can notice it is a button with an icon and text, some of the classes have random suffixes. But there's also a `data-testid`, on a button, however when it is clicked Cypress Studio picks: `.c-h-flex > .copy-5` instead, which - yes, is static, but far from being unique. `data-testid` (and it's alternatives like: `data-cy` and `data-test`) should be given priority. Or at least there should be a config option that would allow us to give them priority. So if any kind of `data-testid` is present, Cypress Studio should pick it instead of it's descendants or ancestors.

### Why is this needed?

It is needed to always pick the most unique selector of the element, when it is available.

The response body is not always displayed in the console props for xhr requests. There appears to be a race condition between the xhr request finishing and the proxy sending the `response:received` event.

Proxy sends the `response:received` event:

2) Due to the flexibility of ""cy.get(..)"" the expression ""cy.get('@myAlias');"" cannot return the specific type ""Cypress.Chainable<Interception>"". It would be nice to have an function like ""cy.getIntercept('@myAlias')"" that returns the alias with the type Cypress.Chainable<Interception>.

3) Typing for  ""Cypress.Commands.Add('myCommand' ,{type:'assertion', prevSubject: false},...)"" is missing (because of the ""type"" parameter).

### Why is this needed?

1) It would be much easier to write custom assertion methods based on the ""Interception"" type when using TypeScript. Right now you always need to guess how the fields are named. Use the power of TypeScript and expose the type and make it usable via a specific command for retrieving network alias

2) Is optional. Could also be by done in each project on it's own, once the type ""Interception"" is exposed. But a specific function would be handy.

3) Example usage of the ""type"" parameter in addCommand:

- https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/develop/packages/driver/src/cy/commands/aliasing.ts#L5
- https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/develop/packages/driver/src/cy/commands/asserting.ts#L133

And here is one line I found which handles the type 'assertion'.. (but I don't know if there are more places that do something with this particular type)
https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/develop/packages/driver/src/cypress/cy.ts#L806

The types in https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/develop/cli/types/cypress.d.ts#L458 should incooporate this feature and the documentation should make it clear what the type does.

1225675386,"{downArrow} on input type ""number"" inconsistent across browsers","### Current behavior

I have a form field of `type=number` that should only allow positive numbers. I set the `min-tag` to `1` so that when you click the little down-arrow in the field, or fill in the field with the down-arrow-key, it won't change the field value to less than `1`.

The test I wrote passes on firefox, but not on electron. On electron nothing gets typed in the field

   .should(""have.value"", 1);
```
where the first `{downArrow}` changes the empty value to `1` and the second `{downArrow}` does nothing, as intended. (in firefox)

The input field is a  simple `<input name=""working_hours"" type=""number"" min=""1"" data-testid=""input-working_hours"">`

As you can see first the ENV is set and in the next step it's value is recognized correctly.
After the second test file visits a page, the ENVs are all undefined.

Also, I found out that the ENVs are known when I don't visit a page in the second file and they are also known when I restart the test via the restart button after I started the test. If I close the browser and then run the test again, Cypress does not know the ENVs again on the first run.

1224333069,[Spike] Investigate increased memory usage with recent Firefox versions (98+),"### Current behavior

When updating our internal CI image to run with Firefox 98, one of our existing builds started timing out/crashing due to a lack of resources. [Example](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/cypress-io/cypress/36853/workflows/0372af92-795e-47b2-9579-d93749d37827/jobs/1478739)

I was able to trace this increase back to a commit and gather some metrics before/after it was merged:

Spec ran: [runner/cypress/integration/reporter.errors.spec.js](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/develop/packages/runner/cypress/integration/reporter.errors.spec.js)

Chrome 101 (numTestsKeptInMemory=0) | 1.27 | 1.28 | 1.26 | 1.27 | 1.26 | 1.268 | 12.01

To summarize, with 676fc97f46 (the origin feature branch merge) we start using a lot more memory with FF99. Chrome 101 stays relatively stable. 

That spec file has 83 individual tests in it, and its snapshots can be quite large. So I also recorded runs with the `numTestsKeptInMemory` config value set to 0 to see what impact it had on memory usage. You can see that with 0bb655e379, setting that config property had a significant impact on FF99 and cut its usage in half; however, it had a minimal effect on 676fc97f46. It also had a decreased effect with Chrome 101 on 676fc97f46, with usage up 12% from the previous commit.

We should track down where/why this memory is being held.

### Desired behavior

We don't consume more memory than we have to when running with Firefox.

### Test code to reproduce

1. Checkout cypress
2. Run `yarn cypress:open`
3. Run  [runner/cypress/integration/reporter.errors.spec.js](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/develop/packages/runner/cypress/integration/reporter.errors.spec.js) in various browsers

1224179227,Escape input event is ignored when using `cy.type('{esc}')`,"### Current behavior

If the escape key has been implemented with functionality that changes the text of an input field (i.e. hitting escape when focused on an input field clears the text in the input), this behavior is not replicated correctly when using cy.type('{esc}').

The Escape input event is being ignored at this line: https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/6e03e020682e73e0e5480fe010fe818fce488205/packages/driver/src/cy/keyboard.ts#L1315-L1316

because input is getting set to `false` here: https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/6e03e020682e73e0e5480fe010fe818fce488205/packages/driver/src/cy/keyboard.ts#L1264-L1269

because the Escape event doesn't have a `text` field associaed with it so `shouldUpdateValue` is returning false (even though in this specific case, we want Escape to be able to update the value).



### Desired behavior

`cy.type('{esc}')` should simulate the same behavior experienced by the user when hitting Escape manually.

### Test code to reproduce

Replace `realType()` with `type()` and the test will fail.

1223407495,Visiting a cross origin page with a `cy.origin` command with no cy commands may cause subsequent tests to hang.,"### Current behavior

Since we no longer wait for stability before ending a test test we may now end up in a race condition where an unload event initiated in a previous test will occur in a subsequent test, setting stability to false. If that load event happens for a cross origin page the test will hang, forever since stability won't be set back to true.

It was assumed that setting the iframes src to the `about:blank` page would cancel any current load events happening within the iframe, but the opposite appears to be true, if the iframe is currently loading

### Desired behavior

The second test should not hang based on commands run in the first test.

I believe we have to options to fix this, one more extreme than the other.

1. Wait for stability prior to loading the about blank page in [sessions/index](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/develop/packages/driver/src/cy/commands/sessions/index.ts#L321). To achieve stability here, we will have know which spec bridge to continue to listen too and persist that state between tests. Currently this is handled within tests by the `latestActiveOriginPolicy` state, but that is cleared between tests. See relevant [event-manager lines](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/develop/packages/runner-shared/src/event-manager.js#L538)

2. Revert the change that allows us to proceed in the event manager regardless of stability and instead allow `cy.visit` to successfully load cross-origin pages. This requires more investigation, but would have the dual effects of making it less confusing to visit pages (you could visit a cross origin page prior to entering a cy.origin block and allow us to remove code around syncing stability as you could not exit the command queue without being stable. Any any commands run after a visit would have to run against the correct origin. The downside of this approach would be that again, we'd be waiting on stability before exiting mocha blocks (but we've seen what not waiting can do) and we'd have to error in `cy.visit`s on load functions if someone attempts to run them against a cross origin url. On loads would also have to be setup prior to visiting.

### Test code to reproduce

The following test can be used to reproduce this issue in the 'driver' package of the cypress repo. This is most easily reproduced on firefox, but has also been observed on chrome.

```javascript
// The first test executes fast enough that the onunload event occurs at the beginning of the second test.
it.only('runs', () => {
  cy.visit('/fixtures/primary-origin.html')
  cy.get('a[data-cy=""cross-origin-secondary-link""]').click()

    expect(true).to.equal(true)

I have set up **retries :1**, so when any test fails, it will retry the same test again. This is normally working fine, but: In Cypress test runner when some step fails and I immediately press STOP, then the second attempt is still starting, even I have stopped the test execution. This is quite annoying, because after failure I press stop and I am analyzing the cause of failure, but as the second attempt is starting and ignoring that I pressed stop, it will close the Attempt1 section and shows the same failure in second Attempt section.

1210952852,Element (position: fixed) should not be considered hidden if covered up by a non-hidden element,"### Current behavior

Given that we have an element, identified by `menu`, that is `position: fixed`
And there is a modal container element, identified by `modal`, covering entire screen (`position: absolute; width: 100vw; height: 100vh`) but currently closed (or hidden, either `opacity: 0` or `visibility: hidden` or `display: none`)
Then running test `cy.get('menu').should('be.visible')` throws an error
```
This element <div#menu> is not visible because it has CSS property: position: fixed and it's being covered by another element:

<div id=""modal"" style=""opacity: 0"">
```

This is ok according to the cypress spec and doc saying : 

An element is considered hidden if its CSS property is position: fixed and it's offscreen or covered up


### Desired behavior

I find this spec misses an important check, that should be : 

An element is considered hidden if its CSS property is position: fixed and it's offscreen or covered up **_by a non-hidden element_**

In my case the modal is not opened (hidden). The browser itself let me interact with the menu, so cypress should ""see"" the same and say that this menu is visible.

### Test code to reproduce

Here is a codesandbox link to small react app showing this case : https://codesandbox.io/s/bold-darwin-5rgt6f

Actually, in production we use Material UI with a Modal component having `keepMounted: true` for custom animation reason: https://mui.com/material-ui/api/modal/

We have this left side menu with `position: fixed` in the main content of the page, and a right side content scrolling, as shown in codesandbox.

So, the modal is always in DOM, even when it's closed (due to keepMounted: true), on top of anything and detached from the main content (position: absolute, z-index: 1000, fullscreen etc...). The only thing that makes it hidden is opacity: 0 and/or visibility: hidden

Due to this current cypress specification, we are unable to write a test to assert that the side menu is visible. Cypress believes that the modal covers everything. No matter if it's open or closed (visible or hidden).

1209865803,`blockHosts` test configuration override failing to apply,"### Current behavior

Hello, I've been troubleshooting some strange behavior when leveraging the [`blockHosts`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#blockHosts) configuration value and overriding the value with the [Test Specific Configuration](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Test-specific-Configuration) options.

Steps/setup:
1. `blockHosts` entry is added to the `cypress.json` configuration file as a string value (also tried an array with single string)
2. added an override for a test suite to set the `blockHosts` entry to `null` (the default) `describe('my suite', {blockHosts: null}, () => {});`

Current setup:
```js
// cypress.json
{ ""blockHosts"": ""*.pendo.io"" }

// integration/my-suite.test.js
describe('my suite', {blockHosts: ''}, () => {});
```
The specific `my suite` test suite continues to block requests to `pendo.io`.

What I've identified thus far:
1. config is set properly (confirmed the settings GUI)
2. logged the `Cypress.config()` value and confirmed that `blockHosts` is mutated to be an empty string

I have tried with various different values for the `blockHosts` and also tried using the `Cypress.config` API directly but experienced the same behavior. From my understanding the `blockHosts` [configuration value](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Test-Configuration) is **not** one of the read only configuration options.

### Desired behavior

When providing `blockHosts` as a configuration value for a test suite, it **should** override the current `blockHosts` value and the cypress test **should** respect the new `blockHosts` value. This same override should be applicable using `Cypress.config('blockHosts', '')`

I have been able to replicate this in 2 repos now so you should be able to use any existing tests to try to override the `blockHosts` configuration option.

1208419785,Changing the visited page's location before onload event will make Cypress timeout,"### Current behavior

It seems that when the page being visited by Cypress attempts to change the location before the load event is triggered, Cypress will then wait forever for the load event, even after the new page has been fully loaded (maybe it waits for the first page to fire the load event ?).

### Desired behavior

Cypress shouldn't timeout when being redirected to a new page.

### Test code to reproduce


Page that's being visited:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <script type=""text/javascript"">
        // changing the page's location before the page has been loaded will make Cypress timeout
        // visiting the next page
        window.location.replace('https://warpdesign.fr/tests/another/')
    </script>
    <body>
        Redirect Test
    </body>
</html>
```

This simple test will trigger a timeout error when visiting the above page:


```js
/// <reference types=""cypress"" />
describe('page', () => {
  it('triggers a timeout error', () => {
    cy.visit('/index2.html')
  })
})
```

I made a repo to reproduce the problem: https://github.com/warpdesign/cypress-test-redirect-before-onload

- `timesout.spec.js`: the visited page updates `document.location` before the page has been loaded -> cypress times out
- `works.spec.js`: the visited page updates `document.location` after the page has been loaded -> no timeout

I have a `cy.contains()` call with the following:

1203543217,Cypress scrolls to element when page hides overflow and user would not be able to scroll,"### Current behavior

Currently Cypress scrolls to element when it is out of viewport and page hides overflow. In the below screenshots we have three elements. User can see and reach the yellow button when the screen is big enough. But when it is smaller they can't reach it. In the second case Cypress scrolls to the yellow button and finds it and interacts with it even though the user would not be able to do that.

Yellow button can be seen and interacted with here:
![yellow_button_shown](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27669053/163226335-7056cb7e-7e43-433d-a2f1-6d31df8299df.png)

User can't see or interact with the yellow button:

### Desired behavior

In this situation Cypress should not be able to find and interact with the yellow button when the screen is small because a real user wouldn't be able to do that either. They have no means to scroll to it. This is a problem, because there could be a bug in the page that could put elements outside of reach of user, but Cypress would still find them and be able to interact with them thus we would not be able to find the bug with Cypress.

1197108323,"Function as an argument to resolve the selector in cy.get, cy.contains, etc.","### What would you like?

Currenty, cy.get() and other similar functions only take static values as selector, it would be good if we could pass a fuction that could yield a selector - thus making the selector dynamic. 

For example, instead of, 

cy.get(""x"") 

it would be good if we could also write, 

cy.get(() => (""x"")) 

### Why is this needed?

Dynamic selectors can be useful when, unique id are coming from backend. 
Also on the frontend side, if we have fix relations between ids of parent and child, it would be useful write a function that computes the ids instead of having to hardcode them every time.

1191519931,"Intermittent requests hanging, eventually crashing the tab/browser","### Current behavior

This is an issue we've been seeing for some time intermittently in our CI pipeline, but we had a particularly clean / minimal example on Friday so this issue will specifically reference what we saw on that occasion.

We observed that one of our parallel runners had stopped emitting any output, suggesting that Cypress was stuck somewhere. Using VNC, we remoted into the display that Cypress uses to see what was going on, and what we saw was the browser spinning trying to load our tests. The browser was fully responsive, and refreshing the tab saw it getting stuck in the same place every time:

In the network tab, we could see that it was the XHR request to `$BASE_URL/__cypress/tests?p=integration/ci/glean/tasks.spec.ts` which was getting stuck. Chrome listed it as 'Pending' - I've attached some screenshots of what we could see in the network tab itself.

We were also able to reproduce in the Chrome console by firing off a manual `fetch('$BASE_URL/__cypress/tests?p=integration/ci/glean/tasks.spec.ts')` - the promise that was returned never completed. We did this about three times, before firing off one for a different spec file to see what would happen. Immediately as we did this, the browser completely crashed and we got a Javascript heap out of memory in the runner logs - see [crashed output.txt](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/files/8408534/crashed.output.txt).

We've been trying to narrow down this issue for some time now, and have held off raising a Cypress issue as we were concerned that it might be a regression in our own app. However, in this instance the problem was occurring before our site was even loaded, leading us to believe it's a Cypress issue (specifically around the way that requests are proxied).

1190419236,Wayland support on Linux,"### What would you like?

It would be great to have Cypress run natively with Wayland (npx cypress open) instead of using xfvb/X11/Xwayland.

### Why is this needed?

This is required for HiDPI monitors and fractional scaling on Linux machines. This is currently only supported with Wayland for Linux, and running Cypress with Xwayland leads to a very blurry experience on a 4K monitor.

### Other

Here's a screenshot attempting to show the issue, top right is a FF window under Wayland which has crisper text, the other two Cypress windows are running under Xwayland and are blurry.

1189979589,Ability to overload default assertions (unvalid DOM or unvalid API responses),"### What would you like?

Cypress has default assertions such as
- failure when pages/calls replies HTTP 400-500
- synthax error detections
-  etc

It make Cypress very powerful as scenario can focus on 'what is specifically expected' within the test, and not re-asserting what is 'obviously KO' for all tests all the time. But these mecanisms aren't exposed.

I'd like to be able to add default assertions to that list. One might think I just need to overwrite commands but what if I want to detect (and throw) if DOM or responses contains some elements (ex DOM contains element [id=*""error""], or DOM text contains 0x* or ...)?

### Why is this needed?

I'd like to catch (and throw) each time an DOM-alert pops into our product with a generic 'fallback' error message, to catch all unhandled errors. Today our tests pass even when such feedback arise. It's tricky to catch those. And putting this would really help us.

I'd like not to code '.should('not.exist')' each time I navigate, but even that would not be enough, as it would still miss DOM repaint.

I'd like a more global mecanisms to overload default assertions to specify a bit what a valid responses (request response and/or DOM) should never have. Even if its a fairly advanced feature to put in place on our side.

### Other

If there is a way to do that today, even very technical and poorly documented, I'd be glad to implement anything using that on our side, and help with its documentation. If you were to develop that, I can also test v0 of this if you need a guinea pig.",enhancement

1183070294,Ability to override config files from CLI parameter --env,"### What would you like?

Hi all, 

I would like to propose a feature that would highly benefit in the terms of customizing how cypress gets its environment variables. 

I would like to have access to CLI parameters in the plugin files, however, there is no way in my knowledge to do that. 

I have the following scenario done with the use of @bahmutov 's dependency to merge cypress.json configs. 

mobile-dev.json extends > dev.json extends > cypress.json
mobile-dev.json contains mobile-specific env vars such as userAgent, viewportHeight
dev.json contains development environment-specific vars, such as authUrl, abc, and def variables.
cypress.json contains global configuration, which should be default to any runs on any environment.

Furthermore, we are overriding variables from CLI as well in some cases such as and to have the highest precedence:
`npx cypress:open --config-file mobile-dev.json --env abc=123,def=456`

In the example above I would expect the following behavior: 
mobile-dev.json read >> it contains extends so with the `cypress-extends` dependency it reads the next >> dev.json read >> cypress.json read. >> config returned in plugin >> **CLI --env parameters gets read and cypress overrides the parameters in the returned config.**

This is however not the case. Config is correctly merged, but there is no way for me to access CLI parameters in plugins, and CLI parameters get overridden by the config or do not overwrite existing environment variables. 

The easiest solution would be to let us change this order of the sources to be read up however we like:

Anyone has a solution for the above-mentioned problem, or have you considered the possibility to let us configure the precedence in which order these values come from?

1174198273,Add Query String format option(s) to `cy.request()`,"### Current behavior

```javascript
cy.request({url: '/url', qs: { list_id: [1, 2, 3] })
```
Generates the request URI:

```
/url?list_id%5B0%5D=1&list_id%5B1%5D=2&list_id%5B2%5D=3

// decoded
/url?list_id[0]=1&list_id[1]=2&list_id[2]=3
```
However, not all environments follow the `[]` convention and `list_id=1&list_id=2&list_id=3` is widely used as well. The underlying [qs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qs) library has an `arrayFormat: indices|brackets|repeat|comma` param which controls this behaviour, which unfortunately, isn't accessible via functions like `request()` in Cypress.

### Desired behavior

Allow customization of the query param array encoding behaviour. A top level param [here](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/62d109cee2664da0423b665c55b62afdba0c5986/packages/driver/src/cy/commands/request.ts#L17) that controls query param encoding may be a bit awkward. A simpler solution may be to use `qs` as-is when passed as a string (encoded externally).

Adding null as an encoding argument to `cy.readFile` command results in `TypeError: First argument must be a string, Buffer, ArrayBuffer, Array, or array-like object`.

1173487180,"Add ""duration"" property to interception.response object","### What would you like?

Hi there,
I have a use case, that during my tests, I would like to (need to) custom log response time of specific requests that I am intercepting.

Currently, I can obtain response time only from yielded response object which is provided by `cy.request()` method.

But I do not want to do another request just to get this information.

I just want to wait for given request using `cy.intercept()` then wait for the response and the retrieve the response time via some property of the `interception.response` object.

Thanks for your great work and have a nice day!

### Why is this needed?

I need to log response times of some backend apis to have a proof, that some of them have bad performance, even for testing environment. These logs would be needed by the backend team to focus on these issues and improve performance.

I do not want to write specific tests just for pinging API. 

I want to monitor api responses during frontend tests using cy.intercept and log the information of the response time.

1162003931,"Cypress defaults (Screenshot, Keyboard etc..) are not reset after test.","### Current behavior

If a user changes the default values of a command in a test, runs the test and then reverts the change, the values for the defaults will be preserved. For example, if a user has this test code:

```javascript
it('should display welcome message', () => {
  cy.visit('/').contains('Welcome my-app');
  Cypress.Screenshot.defaults({ capture: 'runner' });
  cy.screenshot();
});
```

If the user runs the test, the screenshot will capture the runner. If the user then removes the change to defaults:

```javascript
it('should display welcome message', () => {
  cy.visit('/').contains('Welcome my-app');
  // Cypress.Screenshot.defaults({ capture: 'runner' });
  cy.screenshot();
});
```

the test will rerun and the screenshot taken will capture the runner. A refresh of the window is required to reset the state back to the defaults.

This scenario is applicable to all Cypress commands in which the user can override the defaults (Screenshot, Keyboard, SelectorPlayground, Cookies).

### Desired behavior

The state of the Command options should be reset back to defaults before each test, or users should be restricted from setting defaults in such a way that they would run into having stale Command options.

1158918095,Suggestion for Better Handling of Test Runs When Chrome Fails to Start in Parallelized Runs,"### What would you like?

When Chrome fails to start, it would be nice if the Test Runner did the following:

- Try the spec again on the same CI machine.
- If the second attempt on the same CI machine is unsuccessful, end the job but with a 0 exit code (unless there are failed tests of course).
- Try any untested spec on a different available CI machine.
- Changes such as these would go a long way towards Cypress being able to recover from this kind of problem, preventing stuck test runs and eliminating confusion on the user's part.


### Why is this needed?

Occasionally, we experience failed test runs as a result of Cypress failing to connect to Chrome DevTools (screenshot below). When something like this happens the job fails but it feels like the Test Runner should be able to recover from this problem should be pretty easy in theory.

1143451795,Multi part screenshots will retry if the page is completely uniform,"### Current behavior

Today, large screenshots will be split into multi parts and each part is compared to the previous part to ensure that we are not just getting the same data over and over again. If the page is uniform (e.g. just one color) this will cause needless (potentially resource intensive) processing. In extreme cases with minimal resources, this can cause browser crashes (see #20268 for an example of a test where this used to happen). 

### Desired behavior

While this scenario is not common, it exposes a problem of resource management in handling multi-part screenshots that we should investigate to see if there's an alternative less resource intensive solution that will still solve the problem of duplicated multi part screenshots.

1129961762,Form-Data not treated as binary when request is intercepted,"### Current behavior

Currently, when you intercept a request with a body of type `multipart/form-data` which includes a binary file, as well as a considerable amount of text, it is possible that the body will not be detected as type `binary`. Therefore the `toString()` method is called on the body which breaks the binary file for server-side processing.

See [`request.ts`](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/e218960f4e7a4cb2e61fbcaef60b3e1232851f2d/packages/net-stubbing/lib/server/middleware/request.ts#L131-L133)

I think this issue was first introduced with cypress 7.0.0, at least the issue occured for us after upgrading from 6.7.1 to 7.0.0. It does not matter if you do anything with the interceptor or not. In our case we just wanted to wait for the response before continuing the test.

### Desired behavior

Form-Data bodies should be treated as binary.

### Test code to reproduce

Send a form-data request with two fields, one small binary file (e.g. an empty PDF) and one field containing around 1000 words from Lorem Ipsum.

Run the test with DEBUG=cypress:net-stubbing* and you wont see the debug line `eq.body contained non-utf8 characters, treating as binary content`

Reduce the text fields content to like 100 words and you will see the debug message.

1127814832,Proposal to create a new command to combine at least get & scrollIntoView,"### What would you like?

Hello!

Quite often Cypress tests will pass locally but fail in our QA environment simply because an element is present but not scrolled into view. The `should('be.visible')` assertion can succeed locally but fail elsewhere due to differences in viewport size.

This error: `Times out retrying after 10000ms: Expected to find element: [data-test=""{exampleDataTest}""], but never found it` can cause confusion around whether the element was even present on the page (as an aside, making this error more specific to the command like `Element exists on page but is not in view` might also be useful). Elements can be missing from a page for a number of reasons, meaning developers spend their time debugging this when the solution is a quick `scrollIntoView()`.

Since most users would know to scroll to see an element I find this type of failure is to be overkill (unless immediate visibility on screen is specifically being tested for), and would make good use of a command that scrolls elements into view and checks their visibility automatically.

I proposed that we create and consistently use a new custom Cypress command to get an element, scroll it into view, and assert it is visible all at once. It will be called something like `getAndScrollIntoView` and essentially be the following:
```
cy.get(element)
    .scrollIntoView()
    .should('be.visible')
```

These three would be ideal for how we use Cypress, but even just a combination of `get` and `scrollIntoView` would be appreciated.

I will be implementing this custom command for my company's project, but would naturally prefer to use a built-in Cypress command. I also assume others may have has a similar issue with this!

### Why is this needed?

* Less repetition in tests where `get`, `scrollIntoView`, and `should('be.visible`) are commonly used together
* Fewer failing tests because an element is present but just off-screen
* Less time debugging: if we see the aforementioned error, it will be easier to narrow down the issue
* Fewer re-runs of the test suite
* Among other reasons, a native Cypress command for this would be supported in future updates and be given proper documentation compared to a custom command

#### Update 2/16/2022

The goal of this PR is to make namespaces, methods, and properties work on the Cypress API ([`Cypress.*`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/custom-commands)) within the `switchToDomain` context.

In order to get most of the properties to work properly, the `Cypress.config()` from the primary is now being synced with the secondary via #20102. This allows for a lot of properties, like `arch`, `platform`, `spec`, etc to match what is available in the primary, as well as default configurations registered on the new Cypress instance. 

`config`  and `env` are the only things that are synced to the spec bridge. Every other configuration method, such as `Cypress.*.defaults()` or `Cypress.env()` are NOT synced to the secondary and are considered their own isolated world where configuration changes persist between `switchToDomain` calls between the same spec bridge. 

Another important implementation detail in this PR is the outlawing of using `Cypress.Server.*` and its related methods such as `cy.server()` and `cy.route()`. We did not want to consider supporting these methods since server is deprecated and will be removed in the future. Also, `Cypress.Cookies.*` configurations are also forbidden as they do not apply to secondary domains. Likely this API is going to be replaces by `cy.session` and other related methods in the near future. Little `cy` session methods can STILL be used in `switchToDomain`.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3980464/152235042-e016c511-2afd-4bc5-beff-e9cfd972bf85.png)

NOTE: decisions around `cy.intercept` still need to be worked out within multi-domain.

NOTE: The use of `Cypress.session.*` and `cy.session` still needs to be explored in multi-domain, and is out of scope for this PR.

1115262871,"Add support for named fixtures (""@userJson"") to intercept","### What would you like?

Currently (v9.3.1) cypress allows setting the response body for an intercepted request in many ways, but what seems to be absent  is the ability to do something like:

```
cy.fixture('customer.json').as('customerJson')
...
cy.intercept(..., { fixture: '@customerJson' })
```



### Why is this needed?

This would be useful since I share a bunch of fixtures for use in different requests in different contexts; the current mechanisms do not provide a simple way to do this without violating the concept of DRYness or raising other issues. If I've missed it in the docs, please link me to the relevant section!

For example:

```
cy.intercept(..., {
    fixture: 'user.json'   // it's not clear if this re-loads the fixture each time for different intercepts, if so, it is inefficient.
})

cy.intercept(..., {
    fixture: someJsonBlob,   // it is tricky to share someJsonBlob across test files/ contexts.
})

// etc

1115088001,Inconsistencies in CYPRESS_DOWNLOAD_PATH_TEMPLATE handling,"### Current behavior

There seem to be some inconsistencies in how CYPRESS_DOWNLOAD_PATH_TEMPLATE is handled from the .npmrc file depending on package manager and version.

Given
`CYPRESS_DOWNLOAD_PATH_TEMPLATE=${endpoint}/${platform}-${arch}/cypress.zip`

npm 7 works, though locally i've seen the env fail to get picked up because of casing.
npm 6 attempts to replay endpoint etc with other ENVs (this is unfortunate, but you can escape them but that doesn't work either)
Yarn 1 doesn't remove double quotes.

I haven't tested yarn 3 or npm 8 but they should be looked at, as well as windows useage.

### Desired behavior

Ideally you could set the CYPRESS_DOWNLOAD_PATH_TEMPLATE variable with any package manager

### Test code to reproduce

Try out setting variations of

```sh
CYPRESS_DOWNLOAD_PATH_TEMPLATE=${endpoint}/${platform}-${arch}/cypress.zip
CYPRESS_DOWNLOAD_PATH_TEMPLATE=\${endpoint}/\${platform}-\${arch}/cypress.zip

1111883883,Path parameters,"### What would you like?

It would be great for `intercept` to support path parameters with the familiar colon syntax, 

```
/api/books/:bookId/chapter/:chapterNumber
```

These parameters can then be made available on a new `parameters` property of the [request object](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/intercept#Request-object-properties),

```js
cy.intercept(""GET"", ""/api/books/:bookId/chapter/:chapterNumber"", (req) => {

1110226504,Allow registering the same event in plugins multiple times,"### What would you like?

I'd like to be able to register functions for an event (`on(""before:browser:launch"", ...`) several times. Currently, every time an event is registered, [any existing callback is replaced](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/5caf747573321003b8778aa28ceec608c75f54c0/packages/server/lib/plugins/index.js#L28).

I'm a bit unsure whether this counts as a feature request or a bug report honestly, but I figured this was never really intended and so is a new feature.

### Why is this needed?

I use a third party plugin (https://github.com/meinaart/cypress-plugin-snapshots) that [registers `before:browser:launch`](https://github.com/meinaart/cypress-plugin-snapshots/blob/6b95c7a930364b99f2496922159a6d693ad684a2/plugin.js#L22). At the same time, I would like to configure the browser to have `prefers-reduced-motion` turned on.

My plugin file ended up looking like this (edited for brevity):

```js
const { initPlugin } = require(""cypress-plugin-snapshots/plugin"");

module.exports = (on, config) => {
    on(""before:browser:launch"", (browser = {}, launchOptions) => {
        if (browser.family === ""chromium"" && browser.name !== ""electron"") {
            launchOptions.args.push(""--force-prefers-reduced-motion"");
        }
        return launchOptions;
    });

    initPlugin(on, config);
    return config;
};
```

My browser never got the argument, and `console.log` showed that the function never ran. I spent a while trying to debug before I thought of checking the plugin and Cypress source code to see if I might have some kind of collision happening, which turned out to be the case.

### Other

I made a minimal repo that demos the issue: https://github.com/wkillerud/cypress-multiple-register

Firefox can’t access the profile folder and gets confused and says it is already running.

A similar issue was already fixed for Chromium in #7039.

CVE-2021-42740 is a critical CVE in shell-quote version 1.7.2 that is resolved in 1.7.3

> The shell-quote package before 1.7.3 for Node.js allows command injection. An attacker can inject unescaped shell metacharacters through a regex designed to support Windows drive letters. If the output of this package is passed to a real shell as a quoted argument to a command with exec(), an attacker can inject arbitrary commands. This is because the Windows drive letter regex character class is {A-z] instead of the correct {A-Za-z]. Several shell metacharacters exist in the space between capital letter Z and lower case letter a, such as the backtick character.

1102273034,Add cy.selectFolder for uploading a folder via cypress,"### What would you like?

It is great that cypress is gaining native support for file uploads via `cy.selectFile`.

However, one issue I always had with `cypress-file-upload` was that it did not support folder uploads.  Modern HTML and libraries(such as [Uppy](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/blob/main/packages/%40uppy/utils/src/getDroppedFiles/utils/webkitGetAsEntryApi/index.js)) allow you to drag and drop an entire folder and they will handle recursively selecting the files from the dropped folder.

See original issue from cypress-file-upload: https://github.com/abramenal/cypress-file-upload/issues/141.

It would be great if it was possible to simulate dropping folders with cypress.

### Why is this needed?

Modern upload drop zones allow for dropping of folders.  This can be quite complicated to program and is currently impossible to test via cypress(as there is no way to simulate a folder drop).  It would be great if this could be tested using cypress.

1100635814,Conditionally retry a test or suite,"### What would you like?

I would like the ability to natively retry a test from within the logic of a test itself. I currently accomplish this with a complete hack:

```js
if (stateIsCorrupt()) {
  cy.state('runnable')._retries = 1 // force a retry
  repairCorruptState() // fix the underlying state before retrying
  assert(false) // fail the test to start the retry
}
```

### Why is this needed?

My use case is that many of my integration tests share a server state. This is unavoidable in my particular case. 

If that shared state gets corrupted, the test will fail. Ideally, a test could detect the corrupt state, repair it manually, and retry the test.


### Other

In theory, the existing retry functionality could support this idea, but the problem is that it is all-or-nothing. Basically, it will retry for *any* failure, and not just for the failure modes that I'd like to retry on. This makes tests unnecessarily inefficient. ",enhancement

1095087168,Failure to use NO_PROXY appropriately,"### Current behavior

In our setup, both environment variables: `https_proxy`, `NO_PROXY` and the `.npmrc` configuration of `https_proxy` / `noproxy` are configured.

The particular Cypress download URL is being redirected Nexus via `CYPRESS_DOWNLOAD_MIRROR` and _should not_ go via the proxy.
All of this would work perfectly except:
During postinstall the `cypress:lib/tasks/download.js` task has the following function:
```
const getProxyForUrlWithNpmConfig = url => {
  return getProxyForUrl(url) || process.env.npm_config_https_proxy || process.env.npm_config_proxy || null;
};
```
Now `getProxyForUrl(url)` returns an _empty string_ if it matches `NO_PROXY` *or* if there are no variables defined - these are not the same states and should be treated separately.
The `||` treats _empty string_ as falsey and therefore picks up the `process.env.npm_config_https_proxy` but *doesn't* handle the corresponding `process.env.npm_config_noproxy` setting so it incorrectly selects the proxy.

Could you please adjust the function `getProxyForUrlWithNpmConfig` to correctly handle `process.env.npm_config_noproxy` and/or treat ""nothing defined"" differently from proxy explicitly disabled for this domain?

1094596851,API requests are not always ordered in the order they were made,"### Current behavior

When expecting multiple API calls to the same intercepted route, they are sometimes not ordered in the order they were made by the application.

In the image below we make 3 api requests, all to `/api`. The first has a payload of `{ body: ""first"" }`, the second `{ body: ""second"" }` and third is `{ body: ""third"" }`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1711610/148261903-8aa89f95-2e31-4e8c-9a5c-15164b82dafd.png)

As you can see they come through in the incorrect order, with the second & third api call being the wrong way around.

Here's a video that demonstrates this behaviour (this time the first and second calls are the wrong way around).

I believe that `wait` should preserve the order in which the API calls were made by the application.

1094318029,Resolving an alias obtained with a .contains() chained of cy will fail if the element needs to be requeried,"### Current behavior

Hey folks,

i think i found a bug when aliasing elements straight up with **cy.contains().as()**. When the DOM refreshes and the querying for the alias happens, the type of the **.contains()** command is **child** which will try to find a **parent** type command. In the following example the previous command is an assertion, which will make cypress fail with an error. Simply inserting a line with **cy.get('body');** prior to the use of the alias is a work around one could use.

### Desired behavior

The requerying of the alias should stop at the definition of the alias in the **cy.contains()**. The previous command, whatever it might be, shall not blindly be executed in the case of assertions (i do not know which is the correct ruling here).

### Test code to reproduce

```js
  it('test requerying alias', () => {
    // use an accessable domain to reproduce
    cy.visit('https://www.cypress.io/');
    // accept cookies to prevent 403s
    cy.get('#onetrust-accept-btn-handler').click();
    // this command will be tested for prev command since the **.contains()** is treated as a **child** type and **getCommandsUntilFirstParentOrValidSubject(current)** tries to find a **parent** command
    cy.url().should('equal', 'https://www.cypress.io/features');
    // get an alias using **.contains()**
    cy.contains('Cypress is the new standard in front-end testing that every developer and QA engineer needs.').as('foo');
    // trigger reload for new element
    cy.get('header a[href=""/features""]').click();

1087026543,Option to retry beforeAll(before) hook ,"### What would you like?

_Copied across from https://github.com/Bkucera/cypress-plugin-retries/issues/50_

 If there was an option to retry the beforeAll(before) hook when it fails that would be great.

### Why is this needed?

Currently if the `before `hook in any test suite fails, the whole E2E fails and we have to manually trigger the E2E again. This is a pain.

a `wait` that accepts an array of aliases, should return an array of `Interception`

This doesnt seem to be the case when the array has one interception.  The `then` callback receives a response with a single interception, so either this is incorrect, or the type definition is incorrect

e.g. having `cy.wait([@myIterception]).then((res) => ...)` currently yields `res` as a single interception object

Cypress consumers install browsers today by separately downloading and installing browsers supported by Cypress either to their local machines or CI.

* Consumers can specify the browsers to download through config.
* Consumers can specify one of a browser.
* Browsers should be downloaded on demand.
* Browsers can be pre-installed for CI or docker containers.
* Must be an extendable pattern to support more than one browser type (chromium, firefox, webkit)

1070700095,Intercepted request never happens when using cy.session,"### Current behavior

I’m having an issue that only happens when using the experimental `cy.session` command.
Let me explain it.
I’m testing an app that has the following stack: Angular JS in the frontend, express for the server, and MongoDB as a database.
When using `cy.session` with the server pointing to a local MongoDB, everything works fine. However, when pointing the server to a remote MongoDB, after the user logs in (with or without the session cached), a request that I expect doesn’t happen after a visit to a page, and so the tests fail when I try to wait for the alias I gave to the intercept.
The only way to make it work when pointing to the remote MongoDB is not to use `cy.session`, but then, tests get slower (because they always have to login via the GUI).
Here’s a comment from the repo where I’m facing the issue so that you can try to reproduce it (if you want it) https://github.com/brmodeloweb/brmodelo-app/pull/254#issuecomment-985583472.
Has anyone faced an issue like this? Could this be an issue with `cy.session`?
Any help is appreciated.

### Desired behavior

I expect that `cy.session` should work when the server points to a remote MongoDB, as it does when pointing to a local one.

### Test code to reproduce

For details, see this comment from the project where the issue is happening https://github.com/brmodeloweb/brmodelo-app/pull/254#issuecomment-985583472.

1070689633,Cypress parallelization and BitBucket Pipelines rerun failed steps,"### What would you like?

We currently use BitBucket Pipelines to run Cypress tests in parallel. Same setup as introduced here https://docs.cypress.io/guides/continuous-integration/bitbucket-pipelines

BitBucket Pipelines support to only rerun failed steps https://bitbucket.org/blog/rerun-failed-pipeline-steps It can be quite useful.

We found when rerun a few failed steps that use Cypress parallelization, they will run all specs again, not just specs assigned to the failed steps.

For example, if I have 5 specs and 5 parallel steps, each spec is assigned to one step on the first run. Step 1 to step 4 succeeded and step 5 failed. If I trigger a ""rerun failed step"" to only rerun step 5, step 5 will run all 5 specs again. I expect step 5 to only run spec 5 in this case.

### Why is this needed?

This is a useful function when tests are affected by external dependencies (e.g. a docker image that is pulled into test environment that has issues, or a BitBucket env var config has issues).

Ideally, Cypress Dashboard should remember the mapping between specs and parallel steps, and when a ""rerun failed step"" happens, only rerun the originally assigned specs.

1070688820,Extra load events when AUT navigates on hashchange in latest Chrome Beta,"### Current behavior

Since Chrome Beta 97.0.4692.20, Chrome [fires the load event to the parent frame when an iframe navigates via hashchange](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18996#issuecomment-984944344) for security reasons.

This causes Cypress to unnecessarily re-set window props, re-bind listeners, and fire the `navigation:changed` event, even though the AUT has not actually reloaded and the `load` event is not fired in the user's app.

Below is the log output using the reproduction steps below and the latest Chrome Beta. Note the lines marked with `<= Extra event`:

```
iframe load
navigation:changed: page navigation event (load)
navigation:changed: page navigation event (before:load)
app run
app load
iframe load
navigation:changed: page navigation event (load)
navigation:changed: hashchange
iframe load <= Extra event
navigation:changed: page navigation event (load) <= Extra event
navigation:changed: hashchange
```

This causes failures [in our own tests](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18996) somewhat coincidentally.

### Desired behavior

Hash changes should not cause extra work by Cypress or extra `navigation:changed` events to be sent to user's event listeners.

This should be the log output for the repro (as seen in Chrome (stable) 96):

```
iframe load
navigation:changed: page navigation event (load)
navigation:changed: page navigation event (before:load)
app run
app load
iframe load
navigation:changed: page navigation event (load)
navigation:changed: hashchange
navigation:changed: hashchange
```




### Test code to reproduce

For the sake of demonstrating Cypress re-running code on false load events, also put `console.log('iframe load')` on [this line](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/4d35779c8ada80c999537bf9c6d7649c01ff5bad/packages/driver/src/cypress/cy.ts#L746).

1066290263,Update actionability checks to require an accessible name and role,"### What would you like?

Along the same lines of [this feature request recently opened for Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/10562), I'd like to propose extending the actionability checks for Cypress to include (optionally) checking for an [accessible name](https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.1/) and role.

Relevant details from the Playwright issue:

> Accessible name and role are synthesized by the browser into an accessibility tree, and normally (with the exception of experimental AOM in Chrome) aren't available to JS. However, there's work to recreate the browser accessible name and role computation in JS, e.g. https://github.com/eps1lon/dom-accessibility-api, that could be used here.

### Why is this needed?

By adding this capability to the [built-in actionability checks](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Actionability) in Cypress, users could enable this for their test suite and find accessibility issues without needing to rewrite their existing tests to use better element selectors (via [testing-library](https://testing-library.com/) or similar) or run [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) validations.

With this feature enabled, my existing test suite will automatically time out if the application is not accessible to screen readers or other assistive tech due to missing accessible names and role for actionable elements.

### Other

Ideally this would be configurable [via the global actionability config](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Actionability), via actionability options passed to `cy.visit`, and also at the individual selector level, but [the existing](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/interacting-with-elements#Forcing) `force: true` might be an acceptable solution.",enhancement

The page we load should show the user is logged in, but he appears as if the cookies are not there. The Network Application Cookies show that they are set, but the page that is loaded doesn't seem to either see them or read them. Note in this example baseUrl is not set, but I tried it with it being set and not. Same behavior.


I ran 8.7.0 and 9.0.0 and 9.0.1. Its broken since 9.0.0. Tested on Chrome, Firefox and Electron. Broken in all 3. 
In 8.7.0 the user appears to be logged in, in 9.* the user is not.

### Desired behavior

User should be logged in after calling setCookies and then visiting the destination url. In this example when I run the provided code and www.yahoo.com is loaded and I move the mouse over the top right `mail` icon I see the user as logged in.  

See screen shot for Cypress 8.7.0

Now when running with 9.0.0 you will see this. As if the user is not signed in.

### Test code to reproduce

I can't give you fully reproducible code, because I can't provide you with the way we get our cookies. Here is the basic script with a hardcoded sample cookie value. 

```
describe('Main Dashoard login load test', function() {
  context('Login', function() {
    it('When moving the mouse over the mail icon at the top right corner the user should show logged in', function() {
      cy.clearCookie('Y');
      cy.clearCookie('T');
      cy.getCookie('Y').should('not.exist');
      cy.getCookie('T').should('not.exist');

      cy.setCookie('Y', ""v=1&np=1&n=23eno0bmig3ub&l=8a2dn1nck044hib2atdgsc5adwppb5ii12lf2i04/o&p=n33vvvv00000000&r=11p&intl=us"");

In Cypress 9.1, some of our tests failed due to Cypress process the URL in `visit()` calls incorrectly.

This code:

1061561206,@cypress/react throws in Node v12,"### Current behavior

Similar to https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18973, @cypress/react is throwing an error when using Node 12, cypress v9.0 & @cypress/react v5.10.3.

Found when updating the cypres-example-todomvc-reduc repo to use cypress 9.1.0 & @cypress/react.

```js
yarn component
yarn run v1.22.17
$ cypress open-ct

The function exported by the plugins file threw an error.

We invoked the function exported by `/Users/emily/dev/cypress-example-todomvc-redux/cypress/plugins/index.js`, but it threw an error.

### Desired behavior

@cypress/react is compatible with Node 12. It wouldd also be nice if the package.json defined the node version as `>=12.0.0`.

I use NixOS and as such Cypress is originally installed into a read-only location. It seems to me that https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/17800/files for some reason only fixed this for `background.js`. But, please see the output below, from my NixOS machine, with Cypress 9.0.0:

1037601160,Make Slider Interaction More Intuitive,"### What would you like?

Easily interact with slider components and set their values directly.

### Why is this needed?

Right now interacting with sliders is not intuitive. Triggering a mousedown and mousemove event is possible but does not allow selection of precise values especially with a responsive UI.

The other option that worked for me was to set the value directly and manually trigger an `input` event, but it feels like a hack and took quite a bit of time to figure out.

### Other

This is what I had to do to get it to work for me in React:

```html
<input type=""slider"" data-testid=""foo"" min=""0"" max=""100"" value={sliderValue} onInput={...} />
<span data-testid=""bar"">{sliderValue}</span>

There are use cases in which this would be useful, for example caps lock detection warnings. In javascript code, activating the caps lock should be treated as a modifier state on the key events. For example:

```js
input.addEventListener(""keyup"", function(event) {
  if (event.getModifierState(""CapsLock"")) {
    //show warning
  } else {

1026887891,Infinite runtime with afterEach and retries enabled,"### Current behavior

[My ticket on cypress-cucumber-preprocessor](https://github.com/TheBrainFamily/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor/issues/628#issuecomment-943656687)

Semi-reproducible behavior: With retries enabled and anything in afterEach on a test, if that test fails, then the test will run infinitely on the retry attempt whether the second attempt fails or succeeds.

The behavior on my project: I've got timeouts set to 60 seconds and if I have a bad network request hanging longer than that, then it will produce this infinite run on the retry. I'm only able to reproduce it consistently on a handful of websites with `""pageLoadTimeout"": 1000`. The behavior is the same though.

### Desired behavior

I am trying to use `cypress-cucumber-preprocessor` which runs with logic in afterEach. I currently can't put these cucumber tests into CI because of the risk of running jobs infinitely. Desired behavior is that the tests fail or succeed on retry attempts and the test concludes, which is what happens if I remove the afterEach block from the test code below.

Any suggestions for workarounds?

I have a windows continuous integration server on which I run cypress. To make it less time consuming I do not clear the workspace before running it.

996705030,Wait for page finish reloading after click,"### What would you like?

Cypress could be perfect.
In wordpress, Woocommerce reloads the checkout page (not a get request, a javascript reload) when you click a link to change billing type of user. That reload takes a while and then then DOM is rewritten. 
This means, If I do `cy.get('billingtypeofuser').click()`, then `cy.get('stripe')` is detached from the DOM and can't be found. Adding a `cy.wait(3000)` sometimes help, but just as often breaks. 

We need a reliable way to wait for a `location.reload`, kind of like the asynchronous jQuery function `$('document').on('ready', () => {})`

### Why is this needed?

Many tests fail because elements expected to be there are detached from the DOM when a page is reloading after a click. wait(time) is not reliable because in best case scenario, you waisted 4 seconds because the pageload was faster, worst case scenario, the 4s wasn't enough and the test fails.

In a test file, I want to be able to mount a component, run tests on it, then destroy/unmount it, mount a new instance of the component then run test on it

### Why is this needed?

Trying to implement a Model based testing approach in a Vue app with xState, along the lines of the following article: https://dev.to/rjdestigter/model-based-ui-tests-with-xstate-cypress-puppeteer-more-268d

```js
// Iterate the plans and paths and test each:
testPlans.forEach((plan, planIndex) => {
  describe(`Plan ${planIndex}: ${plan.description}`, () => {
    // Start with an empty list for the failur patterns for this plan.
    plan.paths.forEach((path, pathIndex) => {
      it(`Path ${pathIndex}: ${path.description}`, () => {
        cy.visit(`http://localhost:7777`);

        return new Cypress.Promise(async resolve => {
          await path.test();
          resolve();
        });
      });
    });
  });

works because `cy.visit` fully reloads a page; but replacing this line with `mount` doesn't work since the component is then mounted several times.

981055457,Read the PR_NUMBER from an environment variable,"### What would you like?

I'd like to be able to pass an environment variable with the PR_NUMBER related to a run, so it is recorded by Cypress. As far as I can tell, we can pass variables such as COMMIT_INFO_BRANCH to pass git related information, but for the PR ID/Number it can only be extracted from the CI engine default env vars.

That seems unfortunate as not all the CI engines record the PR Number (or do it consistently) or are included in Cypress. In our use case, we use a ""workflow_dispatch"" GH workflow that receives the PR number as an input variable... so we definitely have the value and could set any env var with it, but I don't know how to pass it to Cypress.

If this is doable and I might have misunderstood something, we might want to document it close to where we document git related info?


### Why is this needed?

This would give us greater flexibility in passing in the PR Number without being restricted to default values for each engine.

The symptom is that on our dashboard, the run will time out after 1.5 hours with the status never being reported. When looking at the docker container, it just says that

I enabled some additional debug information with `DEBUG=cypress:server:util:process_profiler,cypress:server:browsers,cypress:launcher` to get a better idea of what was happening when the docker container did `cypress run`.

Now it appears the root cause of the issue is:

```

I found an issue in `playwright` where they had to enable retries https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/5214 because this is an upstream issue. Its mentioned that puppeteer stumbled on this .. https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/2207. When I look at that research, it is an upstream issue in a linux package. When looking at the upstream issue (https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=19329) and the root cause (a race condition in a library) .. it looks like it was fixed in may. Maybe cypress needs to update containers OS packages?

### Desired behavior

If cypress cannot update the package that seems to root cause this, I would like cypress to do the same workaround as playwright and retry.

There is not a reliable way to reproduce this. It is intermittent based on what appears to be a race condition in a library used by chrome.

While using the new experimental feature _sessions_ in cypress 8.2.0, adding a session validation routine does not seem to work correctly. Specifically, when a session exists, but the validation routine returns false, an error is thrown saying that the setup function does not exist.

968547678,cy.session: Caching across spec files,"### What would you like?

The new cy.session is amazing and just what we wanted - the behaviour with `cypress open` where this feature caches across spec files is something we'd like to have as an option for `cypress run` as well if possible.

### Why is this needed?

In many cases authentication sessions are reliably the same between spec files, and starting with a blank cy.session cache for each file isn't necessary. I understand that the reason may be more technical, since the runner may be opening each spec file in a brand new context where it's hard to carry session data around.

962865724,Command Log improvements for calls made from a within callback,"### What would you like?

When a `cy.get()` is made from a `within` callback, it would be nice if the `get` was displayed differently in the command log. I assume the `withinSubject` is going to be set in this scenario, so that seems like displaying that would be a great improvement.

Currently a get called from within will look something like this in the command log
```
get     #SomeElement
```

It would be great if it was displayed like this
```
get     #SomeElement (withinSubject #AnotherElementSelector)
```

Additionally, the error messaging could be better. At a minimum it should indicate that a call was made from a within callback, but it may also be beneficial to suggest that a failed selector may not be working due to being nested in a `within`... perhaps Cypress could run the same selector with `{withinSubject: null}` and report if an element was found elsewhere in the DOM. I think if the error messaging was more helpful and suggestive from `within` callbacks it could really help move people along when they bump into these kinds of issues. It certainly would have saved me a couple of hours yesterday and today.

### Why is this needed?

This would greatly improve the developers ability to debug a failed DOM lookup, especially when the developer is unknowingly inside of a within callback. This can happen often if you're editing functions in PageObjects/UI helpers that are called from multiple test files.

### Other

Here is an example of this same issue that a user was having. (https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14566) The github issue was open for 10 days before someone suggested using `cy.get(selector, {withinSubject:null});` with no explanation. Four months later someone else explained why the suggested fix worked. I suspect that these subtle issues from `within` callbacks are causing developers a lot of pain.

 From the screenshot provided, you can see on line 17 that there is a `- within` but it was easily missed or not suspected to be the root cause. The test code was also provided, which included a within block that had 7 nested `get` calls.

957768771,Add a configuration option to allow watching for fixture changes,"### What would you like?

The [docs](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests#What-isn-t-watched) state that `cypress/fixtures` is not watched for file changes, so I would like to have a way to configure the test runner to disable this behavior and watch for file changes.

### Why is this needed?

When iterating on tests that use fixtures, it would be very useful to watch for file changes not only to the test files, but to the fixtures as well.

With the current behavior, one has to manually rerun the test on the test runner after updating a fixture - using `it.only()` to only run one test helps speed up the process, but still requires a manual step.

956001851,allow setting hostOnly cookie on thirdparty domain,"### Current behavior

Currently cy.setCookie `hostOnly` is controlled by the `domain` property. If omitted, the cookie will be set as `hostOnly`

However, because thirdparty cookies must have `domain` set for the user to specify which domain they want the cookie set on, it's impossible to set a `hostOnly` thirdparty cookie through the cy.setCookie api. 

Similarly, users cant tell if a cookie is `hostOnly` on from the `cy.getCookie` api because domain exists in the cookie properties for both hostOnly and non-hostOnly cookies

### Desired behavior

add a `hostOnly` property to `cy.setCookie` and `cy.getCookie` to allow users to set/distinguish a hostOnly cookie

cy.setCookie({ domain: 'example.com' }) // sets non-hostOnly cookie

950866159,Scope `before` hooks in tests,"### What would you like?

It would solve a lot of issues if `before` hooks were scoped to `describe` blocks, instead of being hoisted out of files and into the global scope.

Especially since all those hooks fire before the global `beforeEach` hooks.

### Why is this needed?

Example: I have to define interceptors in `before` **and** `beforeEach` globally, because some tests set a variable in their `before` hook that influence the intercepts (their responses actually).

I assumed `beforeEach` would be enough for obvious reasons, but the test's `before` hook gets hoisted up and run before the global `beforeEach` is executed.

Similar to how we have the `eq` function in Cypress (https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/eq) that match the behavior of jQuery `eq`, it would be useful to have an implementation of the `slice` function https://api.jquery.com/slice/

### Why is this needed?

There are cases where we don't need to use all the elements, but only a few of them, and sometimes, having a selector with `:nth-child` or `:nth-of-type` is not enough to select the subset. There is the `:lt` selector, but it is deprecated https://api.jquery.com/lt-selector/ and more than that, it can be confused as it is not an oficial CSS selector.

It would make cypress version management more easy if the downloaded cypress zip would have the version number in the name. Instead of the fixed 'cypress.zip' something like 'cypress_8_0_0.zip' 

### Why is this needed?

As we are behind a firewall we need to download the cypress zip to install. Further more we have several projects, where not all projects use the same version. Especially when coping with breaking changes it can make a difference.
You are a very active organisation (kudo's!), and releases happen all the time. So wen we download a version, it is not always instantly clear that again, where was a new release. This caused some issues in our organization.

944178874,Provide a way to re-run/retry an entire spec upon failure,"### What would you like?

Ability to rerun/retry an entire spec file upon failure
This is different from retrying a failed it() block. 

Currently, `retries: n` in `cypress.json` only retries the failed `it()` function. 
Sometime due to server issues, these retrying mechanism on individual it() blocks are not enough. Also this retry mechanism doesn't retry the `before()` hooks. 

I want to re-run the entire spec file once again from beginning including all hooks. 
WebdriverIO has a way of running an entire specFile via their config file: https://webdriver.io/docs/retry/#add-retries-on-a-per-specfile-basis

### Why is this needed?

Sometimes, the backend server might be re-booting or unresponsive. At that exact time, when tests run , they will fail as the server is not ready. Here the retry mechanism will not be of much help as it retries the same thing again and again, although there is no response coming from the backend. 
When we run the same spec again manually, it passes, because by that time, the server has recovered. This is a big false positive from the testing side. 

In such cases, I want to retry the entire spec as many times as I want (via a config setting as mentioned above, similar to webdriverIO).

Re-running those failed specs will prevent failed builds due to flaky servers. ",enhancement

940772843,DOM snapshots that use @import directive are not restored correctly.,"Cypress v7.7.0 (but all versions of Cypress are affected I believe)

I have noticed a pretty terrible jumping when using time-traveling debugger in Cypress. All DOM snapshots are jumping, the element overlays are incorrect, making the debugging impossible. I have finally traced it to the CSS style attribute used by the application. As many modern apps, the site imports a reset.css stylesheet (similar to https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) using the `@import url()` keyword. In that case the time-traveling DOM snapshots are really bad.

I created a reproduction in https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-test-tiny/tree/import-css-demo showing what is working and what is not woring

## Working cases

### Using style tag without any imports

If the reset style is directly included in the HTML, there is no problem

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- reset CSS style -->
    <style>
      body {
        margin: 0;

### Using linked stylesheet

We can move the reset style into its own CSS resource and link it from the doc

```html

## Not working

Now imagine the style is imported using `@import url` directive

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- reset CSS style via import -->
    <style>
      @import url('cypress/fixtures/reset.css');
    </style>
    <style>
      .signup {
        border: 1px;
        cursor: pointer;
        color: red;
        background: yellow;
        padding: 2em;
        margin-left: 10em;
        margin-top: 2em;
        width: 8em;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <button class=""signup"">Sign up</button>
  </body>
</html>
```

The DOM snapshot shows ""jump"" while the CSS is loaded

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2212006/125085305-6f300180-e098-11eb-859f-8ec9c88881a8.mp4

The the imported CSS resource is remote, the jumps are even more pronounced. I have simulated the CSS delay using an intercept

```js
it('DOM snapshots jump with CSS resource delay', () => {
  cy.intercept('reset.css', {
    fixture: 'reset.css',
    delay: 500,
  })
  cy.visit('index-with-css-import.html')
  cy.get('button').click()
})
```
Notice how the test runner is making the CSS request again and again.

## Expected result

No DOM jumps in time-traveling debugger. In a larger site it becomes impossible to use the debugger.

933997697,Code in before hooks are rerun when navigating to new superdomain,"### Current behavior
In a single test script, with a single describe that contains a before(), beforeEach(), and beforeAfter(), the before() method can be invoked multiple times.  In this example before() is being invoked before the first test, then again on a test that visits a page with an xhr request loading its main content, then again on the test following that one.  Accessing the DOM via cy.get() is required to observe this behavior.  Another observed effect is that the console is getting cleared.  I'm not relying on a full console log for anything but on the other hand I have no desire for it to be cleared.

Then the GUI seems to get back on track but you look through the console it got cleared just before the Microbiology and Immunology test and re-ran the before() function.

### Desired behavior
<!-- Remember, we are not familiar with the application you're testing, so please provide a clear description of what should happen.-->
Two outcomes would be better than the current behavior.

1. Visiting a page that loads some content via xhr should not invoke the before() in the middle of a script; even if the authors of the page being tested had a hair-brained approach for achieving that.
2. If something is wrong with the page and Cypress cannot process the html the it() should fail so that the Cypress tester (me) knows to go fix something.

### Test code to reproduce
<!-- Provide test code that we can copy, paste, and run on our machine to see the issue. -->

Two tests in the middle of this script focus on the page in question.  The currently skipped test accesses the returned xhr response directly and results in the desired behavior.  The currently not-skipped test demonstrates the undesired behavior.  This test accesses a page which makes a call for an xhr resource.  The Cypress gui kind of blinks, the console gets cleared, and the before() function is run again but Cypress continues with the test in question.  After finishing with the test of a page with the xhr resource, the Cypress gui kind of blinks again, the console gets cleared a second time, and the before() function is run again.  No error is logged that I can tell.  The GUI log on the left of the test browser appears to indicate that everything ran ok.

Currently, the `@cypress/webpack-dev-server` supports passing a [`webpackConfig`](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/e8da6403f94b488fcdad05c515fbbe052e948a02/npm/webpack-dev-server/src/startServer.ts#L11) argument, however only `Record<string, any>` type is supported. Namely, if I pass webpack configuration of function type like:

```js
module.exports = (env) => ({
  module: { rules: [] }
})
```
It won't work.

### Why is this needed?

I have a webpack configuration of function type https://github.com/chenxsan/mindmapping/blob/main/webpack.config.js and I want to reuse it for cypress component test. But it won't work at the moment so I have to manually copy some webpack configurations to the `cypress/plugins/index.js`.

924355704,Add support for Playwright browsers,"### What would you like?
I would like to introduce support for using Playwright as a browser type which the Cypress runner can use to leverage. Allowing to depend on the browser builds of Playwright allows us to have parity with Playwright test scrips (both using the same build of the browser), and you can get more recent browser builds.

For this to work a few things need to be revisited in the browser detection logic of Cypress:

 - Allow to Playwright to drive the browser detection 
 - Make the use of  calling the browser binary with `--version` optional
 - Allow extra metadata in the browsers list which are relevant for Playwright

### Why is this needed?
This is a first step to introducing support for Webkit in Cypress. If this code is written Cypress runner will be able to run in Firefox, Chrome, Edge, and in the future Webkit. Currently, I am hitting a regression of able to use Webkit with Cypress.

An ability to customize the indent level of logged commands, allowing more than just `parent` and `child` levels.

This would be a simple alternative to having a [group](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1260) concept, and would be useful for things like the `within` block.


Here's an example of an item I'd like to indent (right side truncated for privacy).
The first `get` is an alias, and the second `get` is a part of the page that uses a value from that alias.
I'd want to be able to indent the second `get` to the level of the `assert` (possibly without showing a dash), and the `assert` to a level further than that.

As an open source project with a small maintainer team, it may take some time for your issue to be addressed. Please be patient and we will respond as soon as we can. 🙏 -->


### Current behavior
On an infinite loop in the browser (from the app or in test code), the Cypress test runner, in both ""open"" & ""run"" mode, will hang indefinitely. We lose any kind of test state reporting, there are no errors logged or videos or screenshots for an extended period of time (over an hour).

Some context: Cypress caught a bug at Airbnb where a change introduced an infinite loop in the browser (yay!). However, the user experience around triaging this issue not clear or helpful and required us to extensively debug. 

The behavior prompted us to add a timeout to kill off Cypress processes to prevent jobs hanging on similar issues. 

<!-- A description including screenshots, stack traces, DEBUG logs, etc. 👉 https://on.cypress.io/troubleshooting -->

### Desired behavior
Cypress should detect infinite loops and fail the test / exit the process with information about why the process was exited.

In Jest, as a comparison, it can't continue garbage collection anymore & jest will crash in ~2mins. Which is still better because the process will end & outputs useful information about what happened.

917195768,Support scrollBehavior option in scrollIntoView() to control position of scroll,"<!-- 👋 Use the template below to report a bug. Fill in as much info as possible.

### Current behavior
<!-- A description including screenshots, stack traces, DEBUG logs, etc. 👉 https://on.cypress.io/troubleshooting -->
Let me start by saying that the new `scrollBehavior` option is awesome and a very welcome addition to Cypress 😄! It really helps to avoid elements getting scrolled under sticky menu bars and the like

However, Cypress' `scrollIntoView()` command does not seem to obey or support the `scrollBehavior` option. In fact, it does not appear to offer any option to reliably scroll an element to the center or bottom of the viewport

### Desired behavior
<!-- Remember, we are not familiar with the application you're testing, so please provide a clear description of what should happen.-->
Cypress' `scrollIntoView()` should support the `scrollBehavior` option, whether passed in the `options` argument or part of the current configuration

<!-- Provide test code that we can copy, paste, and run on our machine to see the issue. -->

<!-- You could also provide a repo that we can clone and run. You can fork 👉 https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-test-tiny repo, set up a failing test, then link to your fork. -->

    <span style=""font-size: 50px;"">Hello</span>
</body>
```

```js
it('scrollBehavior center', { scrollBehavior: 'center' }, () => {
  cy.visit('scrollBehavior.html')
  cy.get('span')
    .pause()

### Current behavior
<!-- A description including screenshots, stack traces, DEBUG logs, etc. 👉 https://on.cypress.io/troubleshooting -->

In Vue 2 project with custom webpack config (not vue cli project) I've set up two npm scripts in package.json as follows:
```json
""test:open-integration"": ""DEBUG=cypress:* cypress open-ct"",
""test:run-integration"": ""DEBUG=cypress:* cypress run-ct"",
```

✅  When running `test:open-integration` - Cypress opens browser with spec file that it found. Clicking on the file runs test as expected.

❌  When running `test:run-integration` - Cypress hangs after bundling step with error:
```console
cypress:server:routes Proxy request error. This is likely the socket hangup issue, we can basically ignore this because the stream will automatically continue once the asset will be available Error: socket hang up
    at connResetException (internal/errors.js:617:14)

    at processTicksAndRejections (internal/process/task_queues.js:80:21)

}
```

**Additional info:**

  <summary>cypress/plugins/index.js</summary>

  ```js
  module.exports = (on, config) => {

    const { startDevServer } = require('@cypress/webpack-dev-server');
    on('dev-server:start', options => startDevServer({ options, webpackConfig: webpackConfig }));
  
    return config;
  };
  ```
</details>

### Desired behavior
<!-- Remember, we are not familiar with the application you're testing, so please provide a clear description of what should happen.-->

Since both scripts use same config and `cypress open-ct` succeeds, outcome of running `cypress run-ct` should be a successful test execution as shown in [docs](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/introduction#Set-up-CI):
<img width=""300"" alt=""Screen Shot 2021-06-03 at 6 49 33 PM"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22001260/120733655-72820d00-c49c-11eb-857b-8d640931504a.png"">

In case of an error, ideally would be nice to see an additional, more descriptive message that we can act on, if possible. `Proxy request error. This is likely the socket hangup issue, we can basically ignore this because the stream will automatically continue once the asset will be available Error: socket hang up` makes reader go 🤷‍♂️ (unless you've seen this issue before)

910923562,Wait for additional services to be available for E2E Testing,"### What would you like?
When Cypress currently starts up it checks for availability of the baseUrl. This is great because it allows teams to get fast feedback the application isn't available and should be investigated. In a microservices environment an application contains many services that make up the full E2E stack, it would be great to have a way to configure additional services that Cypress will wait to be available before running tests.

### Why is this needed?
Faster feedback loop when a critical service is down. Rather than investigating failing tests, the team should know that the service is simply down.

### Additional Notes
To go with this feature the Dashboard product should be extended to allow Slack posts for this. This would further improve the feedback loop, as teams would know instantaneously what the problem on the current test run is. 

The Current behavior on the Cypress Dashboard when the baseUrl isn't available is that the Test run will stop and there is no way to reliably know about this without checking CI. Slack updates fit this purpose perfectly. 

Maybe a Slack update like the following

`Cypress failed to run your tests because the following services were down: baseUrl, serviceA, serviceB`

Note: If you'd like me raise a separate feature request for the Dashboard Slack message, let me know.",enhancement

            .should('contain', 'developers');  // this command is logged even when passing (expected behavior)
    })

    // example without browsing to a page
    it('can display all assertions after ""have.length.above"" without a webpage', () => {
        const array = [1, 2, 3];
        cy.wrap(array)

Notice how there is only 1 message for the 2 `'contain'` assertions, it only shows the second one.


If we change the test and convert `'have.length.above', 0` to `'have.length', 1`, then both assertions are shown:

I can't expose the real test environment but have reproduced with a call to trello home page.

Apologies in advance if this is due to some error on my part - I did put out a mayday call on the gitter forum but got no reply ;-)

### Current behavior

894652930,"Bigint does not display correctly in Command Log, throws error on print to console of 0n","### Current behavior
There are currently two issues with bigint in cypress.
1. when it prints log output, it says `{}` instead of serializing the bigint. If you click on the assertion, it displays properly in the console:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59899746/118701846-08454900-b7c9-11eb-9e0a-da4b258c72bf.png)
2. If either the expected or actual value is `0n`, you get an  exception when you click on it:

### Desired behavior
- Bigints assertions should display their values in the command log (possibly with truncation)
- if you click on a bigint assertion that has `0n` on expected or actual, no exception should occur

### Test code to reproduce
```js
describe('Bigint example', () => {
    it('Displays wrong', () => {
        expect(2n).to.equal(2n);
    });

    it('Exception on inspect 2', () => {
        expect(0n).to.equal(1n);
    })
});
```
### Versions
This is present in 5.6.0 through 7.3.0, though you get different behavior for the exception in 5.6.0 and 7.3.0. In older versions, it doesn't show the exception and stack  trace, but expected/actual are missing:

  cy.get('.filters').contains('All').click()

890953929,Enviroment based conditional test cases (proposal),"### What would you like?
Hello Cypress team! Me and my team have an proposal for environment based test cases. Our vision is to add additional parameter into test case definition/header, similar way how the **retries** are done at the moment. 
```js
it('Random test case', {
    retries: {
        runMode: 2,
        openMode: 0
    },
    condRun: { 
        hasComponentA: true
    }
}, () => { }
```
So basically this test will run only when variable `hasComponentA` is set up as true in my `cypress.env.json` file. It could be explained when test case or suite is wrapped in `if (hasComponentA == true) { it('Test', { }); }`. ( We are also aware of some edge case implementations such as defining enviroment variables in the test case definition next to the condition based on the same variable. )

### Why is this needed?

The example above is also the way we are currently ""bending"" the system, but we know this is not the clean way to do it. It's the main reason we would like to propose this idea. And the final execution or form of this feature can be totally different from what we are proposing (based on the problematic edge cases mentioned above). The main point is just the idea to **run test conditionally** . 

Also I didn't find any similar ticket as this one so if the majority is not interested in such a feature we totally understand that and we are okay with the way it's done now. Or maybe the solution is already out there and we just didn't find it.",enhancement
890082924,Cypress runner crashes after a cy.request() command times out,"### Current behaviour
The Cypress test runner crashes with a ""RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded"" error a few seconds after a cy.request() command times out.

This happens with both `cypress open` and `cypress run`.

### Desired behavior
cy.request() commands that time out should not crash the test runner.

### Test code to reproduce
Demo repo and instructions here: [demo repo](https://github.com/gabi-dobritescu/exceed-stack-size/tree/master)

  }
}
```

```

app.js
```javascript
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const port = 3000

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    res.send('Hello World!')
  }, 5000)

})

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(""Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}"")
})
```

quick-test.spec.js
```javascript
describe(""Demo test for the exceed stack size error"", () => {
  it(""should gracefully fail the test when api request times out"", () => {
    cy.request(""http://localhost:3000/"").then(response => {
      expect(response.body).to.equal(""Hello World!"");
    })
  })
})
```

To reproduce the issue:

`yarn install`

`yarn start`

`yarn cypress:open`

Run the `quick-test.spec` test. After the test completes (failing as expected because the request timed out before the server responded) wait for a few seconds (anywhere between 2 to 5 second usually).
The runner crashes with the following error and stacktrace:

We currently have `""videoUploadOnPasses"": false` set to speed up and save resources for passing tests. Since these are the vast majority this is a significant improvement. However, this has made it more difficult to analyse flaky tests that only passed after being retried.

For some websites cypress runner hangs when running `cy.visit` for the second time within the same test session. It's totally frozen and it's not possible to click any button nor interact with page.

- It happens on every browser (Chrome, Edge, Electron, FF), in headless and non-headless mode.
- It happens every time - problem is reproducible on given [website](https://eeho.fa.us2.oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperience/en/sites/CX_1/requisitions).
- DEBUG logs does not show anything interesting.
- `cy.reload` or clicking ""Run all tests"" from test runner gives the same results

### Desired behavior
It should be possible to reload the page multiple times within one test session.

### Test code to reproduce
The first test passes, cypress get frozen when running `cy.visit` on the second test.
```js
describe('Test issue', () => {
    beforeEach(() => {
        cy.visit('https://eeho.fa.us2.oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperience/en/sites/CX_1/requisitions');
    });

    it('test 1', () => {
        cy.wait(3000);

873948971,Support Stryker-Mutator,"### What would you like?
I would like to see first class stryker-mutator support in cypress. Right now it is possible to run stryker-mutator and cypress together but there are some major issues. First it takes an extreme long time to finish because its only possible to run if you tell stryker the cypress run command and stryker will call it for every mutation. So runtime goes up really fast. Second stryker will not get any coverage analysis data that will also play in to runtime. And the last thing i could see is it does not really get the test report. So it will tell you all mutations have survived.  

### Why is this needed?
Because of the way cypress works its needed to get some first class api support for stryker so it can hook in to livecycles. Like dont start the runner for every mutation anew but hold one runner instance and run it again and again for every code mutation. Also it would give way more insights for stryker to run faster and actually capture the results from cypress.

871856176,Allow passing undefined or null for no options per test,"Cypress v7.2.0
Cypress allows passing per-test config options object like this

```js
it('works', { baseUrl: 'http://localhost:8000' }, () => {})
```

Turns out, if you pass `undefined` or `null` object as the second argument, the test is marked as pending, even if it has commands

```js
describe('page', () => {
  it('works', undefined, () => {
    cy.visit('https://example.cypress.io')

The only way to pass no options is to pass an empty object as the second argument

864530220,Make a 1 second (1000ms) delay to show Cypress Command Log configurable globally and for commands,"Currently Cypress Command Log is shown if the command did not finish after 1 second.

Most DOM commands should execute within this time but remote requests or DOM objects depending on such requests often exceed this limit and Command Log shows up, slowing down tests considerably.

There are several timeouts available for different command types and several options for requests but none allows adjusting this 1 second show log trigger..

Reasoning behind configurable show Command Log delay is that often tests require resetting the environment/database to isolate tests from each other, in line with cypress recommendations, but this process takes time and leads to slower tests overall as needs to be performed at the very beginning of each test.

My proposal is pretty simple, in the order of importance as I can see it:

1. Add logTimeout option to the cypress.json options with a default value of 1000 (ms).
2. Add cy.request() option logTimeout which when set will override cypress.json logTimeout allowing to specify a custom delay after which Command Log will be shown for this request
3. Add logTimeout to all other functions with already have a timeout option (cy.get(), cy.click() etc) allowing to handle slow dom-triggered requests.

Having only globally configurable logTimeout (1) should be enough in most cases and since it is a global setting there is a high probability it will be easy to implement so please consider it a priority even if (2) and (3) would be a nice addition.",enhancement

However, when triggering from the command line with `npx cypress run --spec 'cypress/integration/{[!fix]*.spec.js,!(_unit)/**/[!fix]*.spec.js}'`, I get the message 
```
Can't run because no spec files were found.

We searched for any files matching this glob pattern:

cypress/integration/{[!fix]*.spec.js,!(_unit)/**/[!fix]*.spec.js}

/Users/username/path/to/project

853275033,Open devtools inside the playground iframe with a simple button,"### What would you like?
<!-- A clear description of the feature or enhancement wanted in Cypress -->
_When I want to inspect the DOM, I have to use shortcut or click right + Inspect element._
Have some latency before the devtools is opened.

And because the playground is in an iframe, it could be very nice to integrate the dev tools directly inside the iframe, because we didn't want to inspect Cypress app, only the playground.
You can see with @antfu [Vite VS Code project](https://github.com/antfu/vscode-vite) to get some inspiration for devtool integration (which would be sadly only available for Chromium based browser)

<u>Summary:</u>

- Integrate the devtools inside the playground iframe
- Add a button to open dev tools (or inspect DOM element which open the devtools directly with the element inspected visible).

### Why is this needed?
For better inspection tools and a fully tools set during TDD tests writing (especially for Component Testing !)

852746827,Cypress.log() lacks a way to highlight a DOM element,"**Summary:** In a custom command using `Cypress.log()` and passing `{log: false}` to all sub-comands, it is impossible to have information about the DOM elements being selected by the command or have them highlighted in the page.

## Current behavior

Here is a screenshot showing a custom command not using `Cypress.log()`:

![2021-04-07-210738](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/217543/113922122-322d4800-97e7-11eb-8054-ce5512ff4afc.png)

You can see the seleted DOM element is highlighted in the top-right and some information is visible in the console. This is implemented by this custom command (from the [realworld-app](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app/blob/v1.0.16/cypress/support/commands.ts#L35)):

```js
Cypress.Commands.add(""getBySel"", (selector, ...args) => {
  return cy.get(`[data-test=${selector}]`, ...args);
})
```
 
If you want to go fancy or just write a more complex command without polluting the command log, you would typically use the ([under documented](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-documentation/issues/3139)) `Cypress.log()` function. Something like this for example:

```js
Cypress.Commands.add(""getBySel"", (selector, ...args) => {
    Cypress.log({
        name: ""getBySel"",
        message: selector
    });

    return cy.get(`[data-test=${selector}]`, {log: false});
});
```

This indeed cleans up the command log a bit but now the DOM element is not highlighted anymore and the console don't show information:

![2021-04-07-211021](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/217543/113922952-3ad24e00-97e8-11eb-95c1-7cba63dc03c9.png)

I know about the non-documented `consoleProps` option to `Cypress.log()` and the `set()` method but I don't know how to use them to get the same behavior as the standard `cy.get()` command without polluting the command log.

### Desired behavior

I would like to write custom commands that control the command log while still having a way to get the selected DOM elements highlighted in the page and get information in the console log.

852063225,[7.0.0] cy.intercept(): stubbed responses still send request to server,"### Current behavior
After upgrading from 6.7.1 to 7.0.0, I noticed my tests are still working as expected, but my server logs show requests being made to my server for intercepted requests using fixtures, objects, or strings.
```
    cy.intercept('/api/getThings', { fixture: 'getThings' });
    cy.intercept('/api/getAnotherThing', 'AnotherThing');
    cy.intercept('/api/getYetAnotherThing', { text: 'YetAnotherThing' });
```
Each of these intercepts _will_ return the stubbed response, but the requests are still being made afterward.

Example server log:
```
GET /api/getThings 200 4.389 ms - -
error: GET - 500 - /api/getThings -- some error because I'm not using a live service
GET /api/getAnotherThing 200 2.312 ms - -
error: GET - 500 - /api/getThings -- some error because I'm not using a live service
GET /api/getYetAnotherThing 200 4.231 ms - -
error: GET - 500 - /api/getYetAnotherThing -- some error because I'm not using a live service
```

### Desired behavior
The requests should NOT go to the server after returning the stubbed response.
```
GET /api/getThings 200 4.389 ms - -
GET /api/getAnotherThing 200 2.312 ms --
GET /api/getYetAnotherThing 200 4.231 ms --
```

### Current workaround
`req.reply` works as expected, blocking the requests to the server.
```
    cy.intercept('/api/getThings', (req) => req.reply({ fixture: 'getThings' }));
    cy.intercept('/api/getAnotherThing', (req) => req.reply('AnotherThing'));
    cy.intercept('/api/getYetAnotherThing', (req) => req.reply({ text: 'YetAnotherThing' }));

851020100,Assert on HTML contents always fails if HTML includes a symbol,"### Current behavior

There is an element 
```
<span>
&radic;y
</span>
```
 .. i.e. square root of y.

The assertion

    cy.get('span').should('have.html', ""&radic;y"");

fails.

This is Cypress 6.6.0.

It is unclear how (or if) it is possible to make this assertion work. It seems to work fine with other HTML content.

848283306,Support application/xhtml+xml content-type in cy.visit() command,"### What would you like?
The `cy.visit()` command only supports text/html response content-type or documents which can be parsed as HTML. We need the ability to support XHTML documents by allowing response content-type containing `application/xhtml+xml.*` and avoid the following error message.

```
cy.visit() failed trying to load:

http://localhost:5000/index.xhtml

The content-type of the response we received from your web server was:

  > application/xhtml+xml

This was considered a failure because responses must have content-type: 'text/html'
```

### Why is this needed?
Our applications run on some devices that use XHTML, which is a stricter extension of HTML based on XML, which browsers can render in the same way as text/html documents.

The content type is allowed in the accept header, but does not seem to be allowed on the response content-type. The current code that checks if the response body looks like html seems to fail to detect it as XHTML documents often begin with XML declarations.

I have had success asserting on-screen elements of XHTML documents with Cypress by disabling the current error messages and will submit a PR allowing the `application/xhtml+xml.*` response content-type.

It'd be awesome if the retrying of failed tests would happen ***after*** the entire test suite has ran instead of retrying failed tests instantly.

### Why is this needed?

If there is a connection / network blip or flakiness with an internal or external API or some other integrated dependency causing a test to fail, retrying the test immediately will likely result in the test failing again as it tries again so quickly.

It would be nice to delay or postpone the retries until the end after the rest of the test suite has had a chance to run. This would allow more time in between test run attempts, giving more time for the blips and kinks to work themselves out instead of expecting those things to work themselves out nearly immediately.

Have a question? Start a new discussion 👉 https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/discussions

Please be patient and we will respond as soon as we can. 🙏 -->

### What would you like?
I would like to see the full stack trace when a custom command fails.
At the moment I see this:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5892508/111789216-cc6d3080-88b8-11eb-91f6-41598e4248f4.png)


So I can see the line in the custom command that failed and I can see which command was invoked, but I cannot see which line in the test was the command called from.

I'm pretty sure we already get a full stack trace for Cypress's built-in commands, taking you all the way back to the line of the test that caused them. For example if `cy.click()` fails to click an element, you get a larger stack trace including the line in the test that called the click method that failed, so I wish we would get the same just with custom commands.

### Why is this needed?
It would improve the usability of custom commands since it's time consuming to find the line on the test calling the command that failed, especially if the same test invokes the same custom command multiple times.

An example would be, we wrote a custom command that interacts with our modals and automatically selects an item from a modal with a specific data attribute tag. Because we have a lot of modals this command gets invoked multiple times per test, making it hard to figure out which exact command in the test caused the error without having to look at the logs backwards, especially if we are trying to debug an error from a CI.

We create Files dynamically depending of Users inputs. The backend then decides the files content.
At the moment the downloaded file gets replaced by the new one and we have no way to check the previose test runs file.

We can set the config downloadsFolder once at the beginning of the test run, but that wouldn't scale well, because we would have to run every spec seperatly.

@bahmutov

Yeah, why is Edge version VMware Fusion 12.1.0? This breaks the version parser we have for browser versions. If this is expected Edge version, could you open a new github issue for us


Gleb, this is because I'm running VM Ware Fusion on my mac so that I can run Windows 10 as well. That makes sense then as I couldn't get past that error even after trying a different version of node and reinstalling everything from scratch.

Click test, browser opens and shows loading indicator for almost exactly 2 minutes before running the test. In debugs, I'm seeing timeout errors like this that _maybe_ are the culprit?

} }
```

Here's the [full debug log](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/files/6135319/cypress-open-debug.txt) too for more context if needed. Explanation of debug file:
- ran `set DEBUG=cypress:* && cypress open`
- search box already contains ""validat"", so I simply click ""validator.spec.js""
- chrome opens at 11:52:22am shows loading indicator for almost exactly 2min at 11:54:18 (consistently ~2min give or take a few sec)
- test runs successfully
- stop cypress

If I simply reload the browser instead of waiting the 2 minutes, it starts pretty much right away, so don't beat yourself up if you're not seeing what's up since it seems like I can work around it.

Things I've tried so far:
- uninstalling cypress, clearing all cypress appdata local/roaming, re-installing cypress (also tried the formal `cypress cache clear` cmd too)
- downgrading cypress to `6.4.0` (we're running current latest `6.6.0`)
- using version of node that cypress comes with instead of what's on my system (which is 15.11.0 with npm 7.6.2)
- trying other browsers (edge, ff, electron)

Let me know if you want any other info about my setup--can provide `cypress.json`, `state.json` in appdata, etc.

If you all aren't quite sure, I might take some time to look around in cypress code. I didn't realize I have the whole thing, as this article mentions: https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/troubleshooting.html#Edit-the-installed-Cypress-code. Very cool.

### What would you like?
A way to customize the `name` and `displayName` and `message` attributes of some built-in commands, such as `cy.get` and `.find`.

### Why is this needed?
This can help unclutter the command log, by moving the ""key"" of what it's looking for from the message to the displayName.

This could also be useful to partially address another feature request, by giving a way to tidy up the logging without disabling it entirely: https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8296

I've tried doing it with a custom command, but custom commands that wrap `cy` commands aren't able to fully replicate the logging:
* Can't highlight element by setting `$el`, especially in cases where you expect it not to exist
* Can't call a callback each time the selector result is checked (`.then` only happens after element exists, and `.should` breaks default assertions)
* Can't call a callback when the chained assertions fail (need something like `.onFail`: it would be block-scoped, and would allow logging, but [not allow canceling the failure](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/395#issuecomment-275499926))
* Can't use `verifyUpcomingAssertions` on the return value of `.get` (because that mixes synchronous and asynchronous code)
* Can't use `verifyUpcomingAssertions` in a `.should` block ([because it causes an infinite loop](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3109#issuecomment-792981403))


As an experiment, I managed to get something like what I want by copying the code of the `.get()` method, but that's too messy, and all the shadowDom stuff seemed not to be publicly exposed.

829326306,"Seeing new ""Fetching resource at"" error randomly with Cypress after upgrading","### Current behavior
After upgrading to Cypress 6.6.0 (from Cypress 6.2.x), we are now seeing a new random error pop up in our tests:

```
Error: The following error originated from your test code, not from Cypress.

  > Fetching resource at '/__cypress/tests?p=<path to test>' failed

When Cypress detects uncaught errors originating from your test code it will automatically fail the current test.

828902112,Expose setSystemTime from lolex,"### What would you like?
I would like to be able to do:

```javascript
cy.clock().then(clock => clock.setSystemTime(12345));

### Why is this needed?
I am testing a timer, and I realized that when I wanted to test it also displays hours correctly, I did cy.tick(4*60*60*1000) and Cypress froze because it was running thousands of setInterval callbacks in a row. `setSystemTime` allows me to skip forward in time, and I can still use tick for small increment testing.

826749012,Cypress should expose list of runnables!,"I've been trying to figure out how to get a list of 'runnables' from a given spec to no avail. However, internally the Cypress app gets this list and then just iterates over it. You can see that the Cypress app actually compiles a list when using cypress:open

![Screen Shot 2021-03-08 at 4 49 48 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/331553/110548426-64af2c80-80e5-11eb-992d-803e40d55316.png)

Before any tests actually start running the list is displayed. 

Even if you run cypress in debug mode you can't parse this information out on the fly before tests are run. Using the DEBUG=cypress:server:reporter option you'll see that this information is only exposed prior to 'each' test running. Using DEBUG:cypress:* does not give any further info into how to gain this list of tests.

Unless I'm missing something here the only way I can see of gaining access to the list is to possibly alter the Cypress app to log the list using the built-in debug() function.

How do we get downloads to automatically go into those same per-test folders?

Dumping all downloads into a single folder doesn't seem like a good idea to me, for the same reason you wouldn't dump all screenshots or videos into a single folder: it makes organization and triage much more difficult than it needs to be. We regularly run 50-60 test suites, comprising ~600 tests, and we'd like to start testing downloads in several tests.

We detected that the Chromium Renderer process just crashed.

This is the equivalent to seeing the 'sad face' when Chrome dies.

This can happen for a number of different reasons:

- You wrote an endless loop and you must fix your own code
- There is a memory leak in Cypress (unlikely but possible)
- You are running Docker (there is an easy fix for this: see link below)
- You are running lots of tests on a memory intense application
- You are running in a memory starved VM environment
- There are problems with your GPU / GPU drivers
- There are browser bugs in Chromium

You can learn more including how to fix Docker here:

The Chrome runner works well with `""chromeWebSecurity"": false` in cypress.json.

### What would you like?
<!-- A clear description of the feature or enhancement wanted in Cypress -->
As described in the last comment of [issue 6665](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6665) the lifecycle hooks `before:run`, `after:run`, `before:spec` and `after:spec` in a plugin don't run while in interactive mode. 
I don't really get the reasoning behind this choice. Maybe this is hard to do technically. But I would like these events to be triggered when running in any mode. 

### Why is this needed?
The reason I would like to use these events is to subscribe and unsubscribe to some of my own events that get triggered by my system to do some integration tests. Another use case I would assume is to prep some data or clear some data that is managed by a plugin, so not to use the beforeEach and stuff of the tests themself but from the plugin.

The following error originated from your test code, not from Cypress.

If I comment out the `Bar` lazy load on line 3 of `src/Foo.js` and the usage of `<Bar />` on line 8, the test compiles correctly. I've attached a zip file mirroring the whole setup. After downloading, run the following:
* `npm i`

809278111,Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'cypress-react-selector',"Hi all 

I am trying to use [@cypress/react][1] and I followed the installation instructions. Besides, I have also installed [Cypress Testing Library][2] to use Testing Library extensions for Cypress. 

When the cypress is started, I have got the following error messages:

### Current behavior
When a user types into an input field, Studio will record the characters pressed and add them to a new `cy.type()` command. However, we run into a problem when there is already a value in that field before the typing begins. If the user's cursor is not at the end of the line, or they highlight some characters and delete, etc. Studio will still generate a type command with the characters typed. This causes those typed characters to be appended to the end of the input when run, which does not accurately reflect the user's actions. See an example below

![ezgif-7-1499f9aef674](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7033952/107547977-18cb9f00-6b9c-11eb-8a14-bbc72f581725.gif)

### Desired behavior
Studio should attempt to mimic the user's actions as closely as possible. We'll have to compare the actual values within the input element to guess at what action the user is taking and do our best to accurately replicate that in the generated Studio commands. This might require us to add `cy.clear()` before the `cy.type()` command or something along those lines.

In our test suite, when an assertion on a spy should fail, the test runner gets stuck and does not fail the test. We have some of our tests remain stuck for 45+ minutes in our CI runs before Cypress fails the test.

The command log behaves as if the assertion is retrying over and over, though it is unclear what is actually happening.

### Current behavior
Currently, the ""keyup"" event is fired in the same *tick* as ""keydown"" and ""input"". I have tracked this down to the `typeSimulatedKey()` method where `simulatedKeyup()` is called synchronously after `simulatedKeydown()`:  https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/develop/packages/driver/src/cy/keyboard.ts#L1193

Unfortunately, this results in issues with the [Slate editor](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate), which waits for a resolved `Promise` inside of its change handling, as can be seen here: https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate/blob/228f4fa94f61f42ca41feae2b3029ebb570e0480/packages/slate/src/create-editor.ts#L84

Because of this, ""keyup"" events on the Slate editor will be triggered *before* its `onChange` handler has completed, which can lead to all kinds of unexpected side-effects. Seeing how the behavior works fine in regular browsers (tested in Chrome and Firefox), this leads me to believe the browsers will wait for the next *tick* before firing ""keyup"", at least. And thus, I believe it would be better if Cypress would match the regular browser behavior more closely.

### Desired behavior
The ""keyup"" event should be fired in the next *tick* from the preceding events. I currently use the following work-around in my setup code that works for me:

```js
const { keyboard } = cy.devices;
keyboard.typeSimulatedKey = function typeSimulatedKey(el, key, options) {
  if (options.prevText === undefined) {
    options.prevText = null;

799098062,Add support to get downloaded file when its name is not known.,"It would be useful to have an option to parse downloaded files when their name is not known at the moment of download. I tried to create a helper function (task) for that which returns the latest file, however, it's not reliable as it's executed when file is not there yet:

```js
// plugins/index.js
const getLastDownloadFilePath = () => {
  const dirPath = 'cypress/downloads';
  const filesOrdered = readdirSync(dirPath)
    .map(entry => path.join(dirPath, entry))
    .filter(entryWithPath => lstatSync(entryWithPath).isFile())
    .map(fileName => ({ fileName, mtime: lstatSync(fileName).mtime }))
    .sort((a, b) => b.mtime.getTime() - a.mtime.getTime());

  return filesOrdered.length ? filesOrdered[0].fileName : false;
};
```

I believe it may be useful to have the ability to:
1. wait for file download,
2. get the name of the downloaded file.

These two should allow handling such cases.",enhancement
799031332,cy.contains('xxx').should('not.exist') try to expect <body> not to exist in the DOM,"### Current behavior
I try to test input validation by cypress
When user enter page first time, user should not see the error message
So I write test like this
`cy.contains('forgot_password_error_email_empty').should('not.exist');`
but it seems that command try to expect body not to exist in the DOM so it fails in the end

When I reproduced my problem, I found this bug is related to `next-i18n` and only occur in `next production build`
If I have translation key `test` (public/static/locales/en) `cy.contains('test').should('not.exist')` will check body exist or not

If I write cy.contains with selector `cy.contains('span', 'test').should('not.exist')`, the test will pass.
But I think this is not the good solution.

### Desired behavior
cy.contains should not check the body

I want a feature to be able to click on a chrome extension and open it. Similar to where people visit a page, visit/open a chrome extension.

### Why is this needed?
I want to use cypress to test our chrome extension, and from querying https://gitter.im/cypress-io/cypress# it looks like I'm far from being the only one who wants this.

You have [plugin code](https://docs.cypress.io/api/plugins/browser-launch-api.html#Modify-browser-launch-arguments-preferences-and-extensions) letting users load their chrome extensions, but then don't have any documentation showing users how to then open it. 

And users then read through your docs assuming you support this and then find nothing on opening it. They then go to your customer chat and get no replies back time and time again ( I stopped looking at past requests after 5 of them were ignored). It's a very frustrating experience.

Please add the functionality to open the extension. You're almost there for supporting extension users, and you already tackled the hard part already.",enhancement

Steps to replicate:
1. set `watchForFileChanges` to `false` in `cypress.json`
2. open a test and start a studio
3. interact with your app and click on ""save commands""
4. nothing happens, studio remains open, however, scneario is added to my test file - multiple times if I click the button multiple times. which I do, because it feels unresponsive 🙈

### Desired behavior
<!-- Remember, we are not familiar with the application you're testing, so please provide a clear description of what should happen.-->

Cypress 6.3.0 Running in Headless Mode, set to Chrome Browser does not EXIT after the tests are done, if the connection falls back to TCP, showing this in any part of the test.

```
Timed out waiting for the browser to connect. Retrying...
Warning: Cypress failed to connect to Chrome via stdio after 1 minute, 0 seconds. Falling back to TCP...
Connecting to Chrome via TCP was successful, continuing with tests
```

Additional Information:
- We have to run ""killall -9 chrome"" for the Cypress to exit, if the tests all passed, it does return a success status when doing this. So it is likely an issue with Cypress during termination.

- If there are retries in the test, which should have otherwise passed due to retry, the retry is not honored, and the test is reported as failed 

- This only happens in our AWS EC2 Linux Ubuntu 20.04, it DOES NOT happen in our Mac Mini environment, maybe because the Chrome TCP Fallback does not happen at all in our Mac-Mini Server.

### Why is this needed?
The controls on the right side are less noticeable and may be missed in this situation. When a test passes, this button is available in the bottom left so it only makes sense that it would if the test fails since the user is most likely looking for the quickest way to exit.

This is what that state currently looks like, with the only exit being the 'X' in the top right:

### Current behavior
Studio will use selectors for elements after an action has occurred. For example, if clicking a button adds an `.active` class, studio might use that class to select the button. However, this will cause a broken test since the button does not have the `.active` class until after it's been clicked.

### Desired behavior
Studio should only use properties of the element **before** an action has taken place to select that element.

### Test code to reproduce
```html
<button class=""btn"">button</button>
<button class=""btn"">button</button>
<script>
  const btn = document.getElementsByClassName('btn')[0]

  btn.addEventListener('mousedown', function() {
    btn.classList.add('active')
  })
</script>
```

Enter studio and visit the page with the above html content. Click on the first button to generate a command like the following:
<img width=""391"" alt=""Screen Shot 2021-01-27 at 3 04 24 PM"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7033952/106046970-f96b4700-60b0-11eb-8668-7b7a2e598ef0.png"">

You can see that Studio picked a selector that only existed after the mousedown (but before the click completed). Therefore, when the test runs, it will fail as the selector isn't there yet.

788257449,material-multi-picker item requires 2 clicks for the item to be selected,"### Current behavior
Currently when using the material-multi-picker component, you can type something into the input to filter the list of options. However, it then takes 2 cypress click() events to trigger the click on the list item correctly.

### Desired behavior
Just like when driving the UI manually, a single click on the list item should be sufficient to select it

### Test code to reproduce
Simple Cypress test:
```js

### Current behavior
According to the docs:
`Fires when your application is about to navigate away. The real event object is provided to you. Your app may have set a returnValue on the event, which is useful to assert on`

### What would you like?
<!-- A clear description of the feature or enhancement wanted in Cypress -->

Today I ran into an issue when I released a new version of my app to thousands of users. 

I added some new directories with php files into my app and all worked fine on my test machine. 

But, for some users the update broke their website. 

The reason was, that I named one folder with a capital letter like so `Example` instead of `example`.

My autoloader was working fine on my system because it is not capitalization sensitive. But other servers don't ignore capitalization and throw errors. 

Is there a way in Cypress to test all my file and folder structure for capitalization? 

If not, could you add this feature?

Thanks

786331325,Cypress crashes on trying to record with an empty key,"Cypress v6.2.1

Cypress crashes if you pass an empty `--key` CLI parameter.

Reproduction steps:
- clone https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-test-tiny/tree/key-example
- install dependencies `npm i`
- run Cypress in record mode with an empty key parameter, for example
```
DEBUG=cypress:* npx cypress run --record --key --parallel --ci-build-id bar
```

Crash
```

```

Note: if you simply try

```
cypress run --record --key
```

The our CLI catches the empty parameter and shows a good message. You must follow `--key` by something else. Then it somehow evades our CLI argument checks. I can see in the crashing case

### What would you like?
We'd like some options added to the `prune` command that would allow some flexibility in regards to which versions it deletes. We would like to add this to our CI pipeline but would run into the issue where if two branches had different versions of Cypress running (e.g. one on 6.2.0 and one just updated to 6.2.1) that they would each delete the other install. 

I was thinking something along the lines of one option that would allow you to disable deleting higher versions (e.g. an old branch with Cypress 3.6.0 runs and doesn't kill our current version of 6.2.1) and an option to keep the last version or two of Cypress installed (e.g. one branch updates from 6.2.0 to 6.2.1 and it doesn't delete 6.2.0 as it is just one version behind).


### Why is this needed?
Allow running command as part of CI pipeline, see above.

785052724,cy.intercept() breaks multipart form submissions,"### Current behavior

Since upgrading to Cypress 6.2.1, multipart form submissions no longer work when they are `intercept()`ed. This seems to be a regression introduced by https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9359

### Desired behavior

I can intercept multipart uploads, as I was able to do in Cypress 6.0.0 - 6.2.0

### Test code to reproduce

As a minimal reproducing program, I used https://github.com/AlexCSR/cypress-intercept-buffer-bug (from the #9359 ticket). In my system, that tests works fine in 6.2.0, but breaks in 6.2.1. It seems to be the opposite of what people on that ticket where experiencing.

If I inspect network traffic using that test in 6.2.1:
- The body of the browser -> cypress proxy request is correct
- The body of the cypress proxy -> origin server is `{}` (no multipart boundaries included)

### Versions

Broken in Cypress 6.2.1, works in Cypress 6.0.0 - 6.2.0
Tested with Node 15.4.0, 10.20.1 and 12.18.2 running on Linux (Arch Linux & Ubuntu)
Chromium 87 (although that seems irrelevant, I can reproduce by sending HTTP requests to the Cypress proxy using curl)

Maybe @AlexCSR can comment on what versions they use? Since I'm using their code to reproduce and get the opposite results.",bug
784972908,cy.intercept by request cause,"### What would you like?

Allow matching routes by its cause (e. g. `image` or `xmlhttprequest`):

```js
cy.intercept({
  url: ""/orders"",
  cause: ""xmlhttprequest"",
});
```

### Why is this needed?

My current application uses same URLs on API and UI side (e. g. `https://127.0.0.1:3000/orders` on the frontend queries `https://127.0.0.1:4000/orders` on the backend). I need to stub the API call, then open the page on the frontend as usual.

`cy.route` was handling only API requests, so simple `cy.route(""/orders"")` would work alright independent of the environment – if the backend was on a different hostname (e. g. CI could use a staging instance instead of localhost), `cy.route` would still match it. With `cy.intercept`, the only way to match API calls right now is to add a hostname, e. g.:

```js
const apiRoot = Cypress.env(""api_root"");
cy.intercept(""${apiRoot}/orders"");
```

This looks acceptable but it's another configuration variable to keep up to date, and can be avoided. :-)

### Implementation suggestion

If I get this correctly, this can't be implemented using just the current setup with running a proxy server. However, we could use the extension running in the browser to match the routes we need using the `webRequest.onBeforeRequest` ([Mozdev][mdn], [Chrome docs][chr]) API. If we can't move all intercepting business to the extension (why?), we could use it to add an HTTP header to all requests (`X-Cypress-Cause: xmlhttprequest`) and match that on the proxy side as usual.

P. S. Thank you all for your great work!

784572091,"static interception delayMs option measures time from ""cy.intercept"" command, not from the request timestamp","Cypress v6.2.1 using `cy.intercept` to send a static response. My goal is to clearly see the loading indicator in the UI, thus I want to slow down the server response.

## Situation

Without intercept, the request fires 3 seconds after the page loads

```js
it('use positive then negative assertion', () => {
  cy.visit('/?delay=3000')
  // first, make sure the loading indicator shows up (positive assertion)
  cy.get('.loading').should('be.visible')
  // then assert it goes away (negative assertion)
  cy.get('.loading').should('not.be.visible')
})
```

Notice how quickly the loading message appears and disappears without network control. In fact it passes on the first run, and fails to ""catch"" the quickly appearing loading element on the second re-run.


https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2212006/104367851-5bd91a80-54e9-11eb-985e-3512a4f7a54b.mp4

Of course, this is a flakey test and we could use test retries to solve it. But let's make the test better using network control.

## Attempt

So I want to slow down the network request to `GET /todos` to always have the loading indicator stay visible for a period of time.

```js
it('slows down the network response (does not work)', () => {
  cy.intercept('/todos', {
    body: [],
    delayMs: 2000
  })
  cy.visit('/?delay=3000')
  // first, make sure the loading indicator shows up (positive assertion)
  cy.get('.loading').should('be.visible')
  // then assert it goes away (negative assertion)
  cy.get('.loading').should('not.be.visible')
})
```

Hmm, it looks wrong! It looks like the `delayMs` wasn't even applied

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2212006/104368454-149f5980-54ea-11eb-860a-44181c1246b5.mp4

## Code

Looking at the code in https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/f43f1c1f26290fc8387697c8122f0f50b6c7cb55/packages/driver/src/cy/net-stubbing/static-response-utils.ts#L106

I see that we compute the response time using the time when `cy.intercept()` command runs

```js
if (staticResponse.delayMs) {
  backendStaticResponse.continueResponseAt = Date.now() + staticResponse.delayMs
}
```

Ok, let's see. If our application makes the request after 3 seconds, let's set the response to be sent after 5 seconds


https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2212006/104368736-795ab400-54ea-11eb-923c-ecd0ea60d6fc.mp4

yeah, this works, but is so counterintuitive

## Workaround

Use programmatic reply and not a static response

```js
it('slows down the network response (programmatic)', () => {
  cy.intercept('/todos', req => {
    req.reply({
      body: [],
      delayMs: 2000
    })
  })
  cy.visit('/?delay=3000')
  // first, make sure the loading indicator shows up (positive assertion)
  cy.get('.loading').should('be.visible')
  // then assert it goes away (negative assertion)
  cy.get('.loading').should('not.be.visible')
})
```

BUT this solution also has a bug noted in #14446 - it uses the first time `req.reply` runs to ""remember"" the response delay :)

## Desired output

when using static intercept, start counting the delay from the moment the network request starts",bug
784541094,cy.wrap() makes methods loose reference,"### Current behavior
When you set a method inside a object using another variable,
it seems that cy.wrap() will loose track of it.
But if you set a method inside the object itself,

let ObjectList = {

            // this represents a method
        }}
}

In our team we want to use Cypress for our End2End testing. We are able to run Cypress on macOS, but not on any Windows machines. We are running Cypress as admins on Windows. The error messages we get are not sufficient for us to solve the issue ourselves.


### Current behavior
<!-- A description including screenshots, stack traces, DEBUG logs, etc. 👉 https://on.cypress.io/troubleshooting -->
To trigger the error, we have just sat up a standard Node Project with ```npm init``` and installed Cypress with ```npm install cypress```.

When verifying Cypress, we do not get any errors, and we are also able to open Cypress with ```npx cypress open```.

But when we are to run a test, either with the GUI from ```cypress open``` or with ```npx cypress run``` we are facing errors.

The error encountered in the GUI (cypress open):

This is the equivalent to seeing the 'sad face' when Chrome dies.

This can happen for a number of different reasons:

- You wrote an endless loop and you must fix your own code
- There is a memory leak in Cypress (unlikely but possible)
- You are running Docker (there is an easy fix for this: see link below)
- You are running lots of tests on a memory intense application
- You are running in a memory starved VM environment
- There are problems with your GPU / GPU drivers
- There are browser bugs in Chromium

We are running the example tests from Cypress, so it can't be because of any tests that we have written. We are also not running on Docker or any other VM. Furthermore we are not facing any issues with our GPUs, having tried different machines and GPUs.

When running ```npx cypress run``` we get the same error. I have attached the [debug.log](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/files/5781147/debug.log) after running with set DEBUG=cypress:*

Since we are running on out enterprises' machines, it might not be possible for you to reproduce the problem we are facing.
But we did:
```

781212222,Delay for intercepted HTTP routes only works for the first call on that route,"### Current behavior
When using `.intercept()` for a HTTP route and stubbing it with a static response with a defined delay, that delay is only used on the first ever occurrence of this call.

### Desired behavior
Every call of this route is delayed

### Test code to reproduce
Given the following HTML:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<head>
    <title>msDelay Test</title>
</head>
<body>
<button id=""click-me"">Click me</button>
<p id=""difference"">0</p>
<script type=""text/javascript"">
    const difference = document.getElementById('difference');
    document.getElementById('click-me').addEventListener('click', () => {
        const before = new Date().getTime();
        fetch('/api/something').then(() => {
            const after = new Date().getTime();
            const diff = after - before;
            difference.innerHTML = `${diff / 1000}`;
        });
    });
</script>
</body>
```

the following Cypress test should work:
```js
describe('Delaying Responses', () => {
  it('should delay every response', () => {
    cy.intercept('GET', '/api/something', { body: {}, delayMs: 5000 }).as('apiRoute');
    cy.visit('msDelay.html');

    cy.get('#click-me').click();
    cy.wait('@apiRoute');
    cy.get('#difference').invoke('text').then(text => expect(parseFloat(text)).to.be.closeTo(5, 0.5));

    cy.get('#click-me').click();
    cy.wait('@apiRoute');
    cy.get('#difference').invoke('text').then(text => expect(parseFloat(text)).to.be.closeTo(5, 0.5));
  });
});
```

However the first assertion goes through just fine and the second one fails with `expected 0.009 to be close to 5 +/- 0.5`

### Versions

6.2.1


### Additional info
From what I can see, this is because in https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/f43f1c1f26290fc8387697c8122f0f50b6c7cb55/packages/driver/src/cy/net-stubbing/events/response-received.ts the delay is defined as follows and probably is only called on the first occurrence:
```
continueFrame.continueResponseAt = Date.now() + delayMs
```",bug
781171809,Page load timeout will not fail the test if page is in redirection loop,"### Current behavior

Page load timeout will not stop the test if page is in redirection loop. The test may run forever. No log output is generated indicating what is happening.

Video: https://github.com/henrikauppinen/cypress-redirect-loop/blob/main/cypress/videos/redirect-loop.spec.js.mp4

The problem is obvious when looking at the UI but when this happens in headless mode in CI it may be extremely difficult to detect as the outcome may be just a long-running cypress process killed by CI.

We had a situation where tests completed successfully locally in headed mode and failed in CI. There was an oversight in test mocks and the application under test behaved differently in CI with drastically different performance constraints.

### Desired behavior
Page load timeout should trigger and stop the test even when page redirects continuously.

### Current behavior

This was first mentioned here: https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3512#issuecomment-754544578

Alias names containing a dot in the `req.alias` (like `get.url`) cause the `cy.wait()` to timeout. 

This does not occur when setting the alias name within an `.as()` command (`.as('get.url')`).

### Test code to reproduce

```js
it('alias without dot', () => {
  cy.intercept('/users', (req) => {
    req.alias = 'getUrl'
    req.reply('foo')
  })
  cy.visit('https://example.com')
  cy.window().then((win) => {
    const xhr = new win.XMLHttpRequest()
    xhr.open('GET', '/users')
    xhr.send()
  })
  // ✅ passes
  cy.wait('@getUrl')
})

it('alias with dot', () => {
  cy.intercept('/users', (req) => {
    req.alias = 'get.url'
    req.reply('foo')
  })
  cy.visit('https://example.com')
  cy.window().then((win) => {
    const xhr = new win.XMLHttpRequest()
    xhr.open('GET', '/users')
    xhr.send()
  })
  // ❗️ fails, cy.wait() times out
  cy.wait('@get.url')

776703677,Allow setting multiple instances of the same header in intercepted requests,"### What would you like?

Setting multiple cookies in the intercepted request, which requires ability to set the same header (`Set-Cookie`) multiple times. Currently, headers is a map of string to string so setting same header multiple times is not possible.

Suggestion: change signature from `headers?: { [key: string]: string }` to `headers?: { [key: string]: string } | { [key: string]: string }[]` to allow specifying an array (which will turn into multiple instances of the same header). This should be backwards compatible as well.

### Why is this needed?

Primarily, as a workaround to authentication woes I'm having (https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1342#issuecomment-752807091). With multiple domains support I might not need this feature.

### What would you like?
In a similar way that there are preprocessors for Webpack, Browserify, Rollup, and Parcel, I would like to request a preprocessor for Snowpack. Snowpack is going to be included as a part of the next-gen [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/blog/whats-the-deal-with-sveltekit) web application framework, so it will most probably become a standard in the Svelte community. I took a look at the Webpack preprocessor but I'm not experienced with TypeScript, so it seems difficult to quickly adapt. Also, I'm still new to all Snowpack options. I opened a [ticket in the Snowpack repository](https://github.com/snowpackjs/snowpack/discussions/2095) as well in case a collaboration across projects is possible.

770993448,Better handling of unexpected HTTP call responses,"### What would you like?
Built-in, simplified checks for http responses. In particular, status codes. 

### Why is this needed?
It is not enough to intercept an http call and ensure that it returns. It should return with a specific code. If you expect a 200 and get a 500, you should know immediately, rather than failing later because some DOM element doesn't exist. 

Forcing customers to write their own commands for this will produce inconsistency for what should be a basic feature. 

Additionally, if a status code does not match, we would like to see the HTTP details. This would include the body of the call, and the response. 

Here is an example of a command that I've started writing. it is a work in progress.

```js
Cypress.Commands.add(
  'withStatusCode',
  {
    prevSubject: true,
  },
  (subject, status) => {
    // If you wait for an array of calls,
    if (Array.isArray(subject)) {
      cy.wrap(subject).then((subjects) =>
        subjects.forEach((_subject) => {
          // Log the body, because we probably got a 500 or 400 that we need to debug now
          if (_subject.response.statusCode !== status) {
            cy.log(_subject.response.body);
          }
          cy.wrap(_subject).its('response.statusCode').should('eq', status);
        }),
      );
      // else, if you wait for a single call
    } else {
      // Log the body, because we probably got a 500 or 400 that we need to debug now
      if (subject.response.statusCode !== status) {
        cy.log(subject.response.body);
      }
      return cy.wrap(subject).its('response.statusCode').should('eq', status);
    }
  },
);
```

Example of usage: 
```js
      // This is an array of waits, so the command above will check that all the results are 200 in the first part of the if statement
      cy.wait(['@load1', '@load2']).withStatus(200);

     // A single wait, which is the else part of the command above
      cy.wait('@load').withStatus(200);
```

If the status is not 200, it will produce a cypress log with the body of the response. I'd like it to include the response and the request body as well. Additionally, I'd like to see it in the Cypress Dashboard, without having to view the replay video. 


If you could take this, clean it up a bit, and format it really nicely in the dashboard, it would go a LONG way to solving several of the bugs that we have had much faster. We frequently get errors in CICD that do not appear locally, which this would be ideal for. ",enhancement

766329584,Test Runner: Expand and highlight matched get elements,"### What would you like?
When using the [test runner](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/test-runner.html#Spies), the get command returns all matches for an element which can be cycled through with the eq() method. This however can be improved if each match on the DOM snapshot could be labelled according to which index exactly it matches. 

### Why is this needed?
Usually the selection process for eq() method is to get all element matches then guess which element matches the eq() index from 0 to ... Lots of trial and error here that can be solved by labelling each element matched  y its index or by allowing the get log to expand into a more detailed list per item.

763434378,click() has side effect of moving DOM elements vertically within non-scrollable container,"### Current behavior

Applying a .click() to an element can in some situations result in the page layout changing in that a containing element of the click target moves vertically.

In this case, we have a simple page rendered by React with a page root (green border) and a div (yellow border) with

    height: 100%
    position: fixed;
    padding-top: 60px;

The padding leaves space for some top nav (light grey)

Inside this container there is some content, (red border) which is set to
    height: 100%

I.e. it fills the remaining viewport space (apart from the padding) and therefore is positioned 60px from viewport top. All is well:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11148387/101978780-da773980-3c57-11eb-8c4c-8c8e5619b79a.png)

Then, we apply a Cypress click to the button element, and:
 - the padding is no longer obeyed - the red element moves UP
 - the click then fails as the center of the button has moved behind the header

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11148387/101978812-0bf00500-3c58-11eb-8e96-254790f50f09.png)

DOM inspection shows that the padding still exists, no attributes of the key elements appear to have changed.
It has been captured by the Cypress screenshots, it's clear to see that it is the click() that causes the move.
Inserting a pause() or wait() before the click means that no movement is seen until the click is called.
Clicking other elements also has the same effect.

### Desired behavior

No side-effects on click.
Needless to say, a real click does not have this effect, neither does the app ever exhibit this behavior in real life, only in Cypress.

### Test code to reproduce

This will take quite some effort to strip down but can be done if the above does not give any ""aha"" ideas, or private access can be given to a repo.

760723402,Test runner window when occluded affects test results,"### Current behavior
We have a ""global loading"" element in our app that covers the entire screen any time a component `fetch()`es data (well, it's more sophisticated than that, but it doesn't matter). I've noticed that if I put another window on top of Cypress's ""Test runner"" window, my tests will consistently fail, claiming something can't be clicked because it's being covered by another element (our ""global loading"" element). The same tests will consistently pass if the window isn't covered, even if it's only a few pixels that are exposed.

I believe this is Chromium detecting it's _fully_ covered and throttling itself somehow. However, I don't think it's only slowing its rate of processing things, I think it's fully halting things. If I add a `{ timeout: 10000 }` to my commands, they still fail when the window is covered.

I can also reproduce this by minimizing the window.

I've played around with covering the window with _a lot_ of different apps -- because at first I couldn't make it fail when SQL Server Management Studio was covering it up, but now I can't even reproduce that. That is, SSMS covering Cypress consistently fails the test now.

756263394,After version 5.5 Stripe Checkout tests break out of the iframe,"### Current behavior
When testing a Stripe Checkout workflow the `stripe.redirectToCheckout` or the redirected page breaks out of the iframe and instead of completing the test just hangs.

### Desired behavior
I'd expect the application to not break out of the iframe and the test runner to continue working even after being redirected to the Stripe Checkout page. (Like it did with version 5.5.0 and below)

### Test code to reproduce
Here's a link to a repo with a simple React app to reproduce the issue.
https://github.com/kide-science/cypress-test-tiny

Unfortunately I was not able to reproduce the issue with vanilla JS. Stripe seems to do the redirect with:
```
window.top.location.href = redirectUrl
```
Setting the `top.location.href` seems to work without breaking out of the iframe, which leads me to believe that there are additional checks before the redirect or on the Stripe hosted Checkout page after the redirect that cause the test to break out of the iframe.

754883505,cy.intercept can leak from one test to another,"Cypress v6.0.1 branch `issue-8999`

While testing the solution to https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8934 I stumbled on a weird situation that seems to occur pretty often.

The page only has an image resource

```html
<img src=""images/tiger.jpg"">
```

There are two tests, but they both create an intercept with the same alias `image`

https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-recipes/blob/6.1.0/examples/stubbing-spying__intercept/cypress/integration/image-spec.js#L4-L18

```js
it.only('spies on loading a static image', () => {
  cy.intercept('/images').as('image')
  cy.visit('/pics.html')
  cy.wait('@image')

  // reload the page, it should send another request
  cy.reload()
  cy.wait('@image')
})

it.only('spies on loading a static image (2nd test)', () => {
  cy.intercept('/images').as('image')
  cy.visit('/pics.html')
  cy.wait('@image')
})
```

I noticed that sometimes the second test shows 2 intercepts for `image`, see the gif below

![leaking-intercept](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2212006/100821014-7e254600-341d-11eb-89c7-8ba93557daaa.gif)

If I rename the alias so that every test has its own, then I do not see anything suspicious. Might be that an alias can leak from test to test if the names match?

[The example in the documentation](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-and-jest-typescript-example) basically does the same: only the `src` folder is included in the root `tsconfig.json`, ignoring the `cypress` folder.

Using aliases in combination with intercept causes tests to interfere with other tests regularly.

The below test will reproduce this. For me it reproduces it about 60% of the time. I can reproduce it 100% of the time in the closed source test where I encountered the issue, perhaps because it has a lot more assertions. I suppose it may depend on your hardware.

### What would you like?
I would like to continue to be able to disable logging of some routes after moving to `cy.intercept()`.

### Why is this needed?
A nice side-effect of calling `cy.server({ignore: (xhr) => bool})` to disable stubbing is that it also disables logging of matching routes. This helps decluttering the logs when we're running interactive tests.

Examples are ping-pong requests with back-end server, webpack-dev-server's sockjs route, etc.

751157013,cy.intercept url change not detected during file watching in Cypress open,"### Current behavior

This issue occurred migrating the Cypress RWA from `cy.route` to `cy.intercept`.

A `cy.route` with a minimatch is converted to use `cy.intercept`:

Note:  Two aliases are defined against the same path (/users)

```js
beforeEach(function () {
    cy.intercept(""GET"", ""/users"").as(""allUsers"");
    cy.intercept(""GET"", ""/users/search*"").as(""usersSearch"");
})
```

When run in open mode the test fails:

Migrating from `cy.route` to `cy.intercept` requires a glob-match (`**`) to be added to the beginning of the route.

The glob-match is added **without stopping the current run** and the file is saved:

```js
beforeEach(function () {
    cy.intercept(""GET"", ""/users"").as(""allUsers"");
    cy.intercept(""GET"", ""**/users/search*"").as(""usersSearch"");
})
```

The browser refreshes and fails against a different alias:

**Solution** Stop the current run and start a fresh run, where the glob-match is honored and the tests pass as expected

As an open source project with a small maintainer team, it may take some time for your issue to be addressed. Please be patient and we will respond as soon as we can. :pray: -->

### Current behavior
Till now (before v6) i could get data eg `request.body` using `cy.get(aliasOf cy.route)` if request occurs.  Now I get on the same code which works before.

```
Timed out retrying: cy.its() errored because your subject is: null. You cannot access any properties such as request on a null value.
If you expect your subject to be null, then add an assertion such as:
cy.wrap(null).should('be.null')
```

### Desired behavior
I should get data from request

### Test code to reproduce
```js
 cy.intercept('PATCH', ${uriPatch}`).as('update_success')
 cy.wait('@update_success').its('response.statusCode').should('eq', 200)
        if (Array.isArray(bodyJson)) {
            cy.get('@update_success').its('request.body').should('deep.equal', bodyJson)    <- here I get this null, works till v6
        } else {
            cy.get('@update_success').its('request.body').should('deep.include', bodyJson)  <- here I get this null, works till v6
        }

747803830,Blank/Frozen Video Recording on Chrome v87,"### Current behavior
I think that the issue has been reported a couple of times but the context was quite different. 

So the issue here is that the Cypress Video Recording is Frozen or only shows the Cypress Frame Layout on Chrome V87. 

It's pretty straightforward to reproduce the issue, just download the latest version of Chrome (v87), write a small Cypress test, and run cypress using headless mode targeting chrome, and voilà.
 
For now, we've managed to partially resolve the issue by downgrading the Chrome version to v85.

747773189,Automatically include CORS headers for network stubbing,"<!-- :wave: Use the template below to request a feature. 

Have a question? Start a new discussion :point_right: https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/discussions

Please be patient and we will respond as soon as we can. :pray: -->

### What would you like?
Currently, users must specify CORS headers manually, if needed:

https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app/commit/2df6ef737ce16a6c81a0a51e415ddb38d3a47399

```js
    // Before: cy.route(""GET"", ""/bankAccounts"", []).as(""getBankAccounts"");
    cy.intercept(
      { method: ""GET"", url: ""/bankAccounts"" },
      {
        // TODO: automatically handle applying these headers
        headers: {
          ""access-control-allow-origin"": window.location.origin,
          ""Access-Control-Allow-Credentials"": ""true"",
        },
        body: { results: [] },
      }
    ).as(""getBankAccounts"");
```

This is some manual work that could probably be avoided in 99% of cases.

We should set `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: ${request's origin header}` and `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` by default on stubbed responses so users don't need to do this manually.

747667065,Expose command timing,"### What would you like?

I would like to know how long every command took to execute during the test to figure out how to speed things up. Was it the `cy.visit`? Or `cy.request`? Or `cy.get('selector').should('be.visible')`? 

We do have this information already - read https://www.cypress.io/blog/2020/05/22/where-does-the-test-spend-its-time/ and could provide it to the user either on demand, or by default

As the first step, I think we could simply add command timing to the DevTools Console output when clicking on the command

We already report duration for some commands, like `cy.request`, but could report it for all of them.

Second step would show those durations for every command in the reporter, like this

### Why is this needed?

People complain about Cypress being slow - https://twitter.com/sunpietro/status/1329545832262152203 is one example, and the first step to answering this question is understanding where the test is spending its time.

The name of the current test running should always be clearly visible somewhere on top of the side panel.

### Why is this needed?
When watching the video of a test is extremely tedious to find the place where a given test is being executed, and scanning a video of 15/20 minutes searching for a single frame is not easy at all. 

Reporting at least the name of the test being run at that moment, big on top, would help.

The current line of the test would be incredibly good, but that's probably asking too much, even if you have it cause it's then reported in errors. 

The current workaround is to:
- Search on the source which one is the NEXT test from the one I need to watch
- Check here and there until the NEXT one is the first of the list of stuff to execute
- Then try to go back until I don't find the start of the test I'm looking for",enhancement

743972396,"Cypress generates superfluous screenshots for passing tests too, after afterEach() hook once failed but retried.","This issue is related to the newer test retries feature. In general, when `afterEach()` hook fails once all other test cases of the test file are just skipped. However when we have retries enabled (`retries : 1`), then cypress tries to run the test case again even if it failed in the `afterEach()` hook. I think somehow the `afterEach()` hook's failure state stuck, because after the test passes for the second try and so the test goes on with the remaining test cases, cypress creates a screenshot for all remaining tests even if they are not failing. Note that I'm speaking about the screenshot made for the test failures.

### Current behavior
Superfluous screenshots are made every time `afterEach()` hook is called. These screenshots have the 'failed' string in their name, suggesting that a failure happened, however the tests passed.

### Desired behavior
Cypress should not generate failure screenshots, when nothing is failing.

### Test code to reproduce
```js
describe('Superfluous screenshots.', {retries : 1}, function() {
	afterEach(function() {
		Cypress.env('SOMEVARIABLE', 'X');
		expect(this.currentTest.state).not.to.be.equal('failed');
	});

	it('Failing test which passes for the second time.', function() {
		expect(Cypress.env('SOMEVARIABLE')).to.be.equal('X');
	});

	it('Passing test 1.', function() {
		expect(true).to.be.true;
	});

	it('Passing test 2.', function() {
		expect(false).to.be.false;
	});
});

743164279,Add global before and after hooks (including parallel run via Dashboard),"### What would you like?
Add global ""before"" and ""after"" hooks, which will be executed before all specs and after all specs respectively, including case with a parallel run: each hook should be called once per whole specs run, not for each cypress instance. 

### Why is this needed?
I want to use a third-party service inside cypress tests. This service must be inited with init() command before build start and deinited after last test with deinit() to finalise build, generate report and send status to a GitHub. And now there is no place in Cypress where I can inject this init() and deinit() service functions, especially for a parallel run case.

I can't run it before and after each spec (using your default global hooks), because this service need to know when the last test is finished to send final status to the GitHub. I also can't use some kind of process finish hooks, because I can have 2 or 3 or 10 parallel Cypress processes on a different boxes in my CI. 

Probably, the best solution for this issue is to add **beforeSuite()** and **afterSuite()** cypress hooks, which will be called before and after all specs run. As I know it was already implemented for a non-parallel run in a Cypress v2 [#818](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-documentation/issues/818) but was broken in a v3. Also I see that ""run:end"" event was added to a v4 (#2331), but looks it was removed later. Why?

As for parallel run - it can be a little tricky but still possible: Cypress Dashboard managing specs order, so when Dashboard sends first spec to an instance - you can just add ""isFirst:true"" flag to this request. And this flag will fire **beforeSuite()** hook only on one Cypress instance. Same for last spec - Dashboard is also know that current spec is a last in a specs queue, so just send ""isLast:true"" to fire **afterSuite()** hook for a specific instance.

Current non-friendly approach is already caused a lot of pain to the third-party plugins authors ([Happo folks](https://github.com/happo/happo-cypress/pull/4) for example). I also looked into Applitools and Percy plugins - poor guys manage suite state on its own service side! It's totally not cool when we have a Dashboard to manage state, but still need to additionally manage it in other places. Cypress has a great architecture, so you must know that it always better to manage the state in a one place. More user confusion examples: [a recent issue](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5160), [first SO question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56006940/executing-a-task-after-all-test-are-launch-cypress), [second](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60772352/how-to-run-cy-task-after-all-siutes), [third](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48110258/how-can-i-execute-code-before-all-tests-suite-with-cypress), [fourth](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54160356/cypress-how-to-run-code-once-before-all-tests-on-tests-start), [fifth...](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58760050/run-before-all-tests?rq=1#comment103831368_58761723) and [unanswered discussion](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/discussions/9191) here.

Probably I missed something and solution without ""you can write your own test runner"" is already exist, but I can't find it :( If I can help somehow (e.g. contribute some code) - I am ready. But it looks that full support is impossible without small Dashboard adjustments. ",enhancement

741403131,Misleading error message when trying to access (probably) detached DOM-Element,"Some of our tests sometimes showed the following error message: `cy.contains() failed because it requires the subject be a global window object`.

This wasn't very helpful at all, because the check looked something like this: `cy.get(""foo"").contains(""bar"")`

The `cy.get(""foo"")` obviously is not a window-object.

After digging around in the source code, I think the following line is the problem: https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/052892d79f95f9792e00d426722a9d904b572df4/packages/driver/src/cy/ensures.js#L84

When all tests fail on the type, only the first error is shown, which in the ""contain""-Case is the check if it is a window-object. It probably should show all errors, as then a user would also see the ""cy.get(""foo"") is detached""-error. This would help in trying to debug applications which seem to fail at random.",bug

### Current behavior
<!-- A description including screenshots, stack traces, DEBUG logs, etc. :point_right: https://on.cypress.io/troubleshooting -->

I am stubbing many (all) server calls for testing our web-app without the real server. As the server is not reachable, I also have to stub OPTIONS-method http calls.

My code looks something like this:

```TypeScript
const preflightHeaders = {
    'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
    'Access-Control-Expose-Headers': '*',
    'access-control-allow-headers': '*',
    'Access-Control-Request-Headers': '*',
    'Access-Control-Request-Method': '*',
    'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': '*'
};


cy.route2({ url: this._urlMatch }, (req) => {

  if (req.method.toUpperCase() === 'OPTIONS') {
    req.reply(200, undefined, preflightHeaders);
    return;
  }

  // [...Actual stubs here]
}
```

In many cases this works without any problem. With one specific test, I get this error:
Cypress tells me that this error originates from my test code and not from cypress itself. If that is true, I am very sorry for opening this issue. But in this case, I think this might be a bug in the experimental full network stubbing feature, especially since this problem only occurs in Chromium!

### Versions
This works fine in Cypress 4.x, 5.0.0, and 5.1.0, but 5.2.0 and higher, it breaks.

I did a little digging at the line it's failing on is [here](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/36a4289a98d65eb16ec5714a9e246dfc5fc56922/npm/webpack-preprocessor/index.ts#L226):

```js
    const compiler = webpack(webpackOptions)
```

Again, I couldn't figure out how to set a breakpoint here and hit this, so I added a `console.log(webpack)` to see what webpack actually was.  What's interesting here is that in our project, in the root folder we have a folder called ""webpack"" with some configuration files in it, and the contents of the `webpack` variable here are clearly from our `/webpack/index.js`, not from the real webpack.  (Perhaps this is related to https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8555?)

### Current behavior

We are running Cypress via Docker in our Gitlab CI/CD and it seems that the video recording issue is back with 5.5.0, reported here https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6408 for Cypress 4.x. The specific image we are using is `cypress/included:5.5.0@sha256:1bade581de1f7ea02b8a000f4526ded862e020adfd5f5b95cf58eb884cb344d3`

As an open source project with a small maintainer team, it may take some time for your issue to be addressed. Please be patient and we will respond as soon as we can. 🙏 -->

### Use case
My widget based application has a use case where in we validate widget/UI page behavior for different customer types. We will have to run a single test for different customer types like A,B,C,D....This customer related test data (A,B,C,D) is stored in AWS DynamoDB and gets retrieved during run time. Is there any way I can run the same test for different test data retrieved on run time (using task) in Cypress?

### Current behavior
<!-- A description including screenshots, stack traces, DEBUG logs, etc. 👉 https://on.cypress.io/troubleshooting -->
- With the current limitations of cypress, cy.task or custom commands cannot be run outside of 'it' block.

### Desired behavior
<!-- Remember, we are not familiar with the application you're testing, so please provide a clear description of what should happen.-->
- I am looking for ways to get a way to run single test for different test data (A,B,C in above case). The test data is retrieved at run time from DynamoDB.

### Test code to reproduce
<!-- Provide test code that we can copy, paste, and run on our machine to see the issue. -->

## My Test Spec File
### Code Trace 1

// Comment
Note: The below code is not working because of variable undefined exception. As per my understanding, this is because of the way cypress runs its commands. 
In this example, I am waiting for my test data in before() block...but the line testDataList.forEach((...) executes before the 'before() {...}' block. 
As the variable testDataList will not be defined by that time, the exception is thrown. Please let me know if my understanding is incorrect or if there is an alternative to achieve the same task. 
FYI: I have tried the same code with beforeEach() block too.
// 
```js
let testDataList: string[]

before(() => {
        // this task needs two input parameters to retrieve test data from DynamoDB.
        cy.task('getTestDataFromDynamoDB', {
            locale: ""locale"", // sample value ""US""
            testType: ""testType"" // another query parameter required to retrieve test data from Dynamo DB
        }).then((testData: any) => {
            testDataList = testData
        })
})

describe('SampleTest', () => {
    testDataList.forEach((string) => {
        it('FeatureUnderTests', () => {
            // My Test steps involves clicking on few elements.
            cy.get('getElement1').click()
            cy.get('getElement2').click()
                ....
            cy.get('getElement3').click()
        })
    })
})

```


### Code Trace 2

//Note This doesn't work as cypress commands cannot be called out of 'it' block

// Comment/Description
Note: This doesn't work as cypress commands cannot be called out of 'it' block. I have tried calling the task from a custom command but the same limitation exists. If my test data is available before the test I would have done something like [A,B,C].forEach(() => { it(..)})...but in my case A,B,C gets retrieved at runtime from cy.task.
// 


```js
describe('SampleTest', () => {

    let testDataList: string[]

    cy.task('getTestDataFromDynamoDB', {
        locale: ""locale"", // sample value ""US""
        testType: ""testType"" // another query parameter required to retrieve test data from Dynamo DB
    }).then((testData: any) => {
        testDataList = testData
    }).then(() => {
        testDataList.forEach((preset) => {
            it('FeatureUnderTests', () => {
                // My Test steps involves clicking on few elements.
                cy.get('getElement1').click()
                cy.get('getElement2').click()
            ....
                cy.get('getElement3').click()
            })
        })
    })
})

```


### Code Trace 3 (which works)
// Comment
The below code works, but here single test is running for different test data....like running forEach block under a it block. I am not sure if this is the right way to solve my use case.
//

```js
describe('SampleTest', () => {
    let testDataList: string[]


beforeEach(() => {
        // this task needs two input parameters to retrieve test data from DynamoDB.
        cy.task('getTestDataFromDynamoDB', {
            locale: ""locale"", // sample value ""US""
            testType: ""testType"" // another query parameter required to retrieve test data from Dynamo DB
        }).then((testData: any) => {
            testDataList = testData
        })
})

    it('FeatureUnderTest', () => {
        testDataList.forEach((testData) => {
             // My Test steps involves clicking on few elements.
                cy.get('getElement1').click()
                cy.get('getElement2').click()
            ....
                cy.get('getElement3').click()
        })
    })
})
```



### Tasks Plugin file common to both code

// plugins/index.ts file

```ts
module.exports = (on, config) => {
    on('task', {
        getTestDataFromDynamoDB : async () => {
            // This task the logic of retrieving the test data from AWS dynamo DB.
        },

A web application which I am trying to automate contains the different text boxes. I have experienced that this issue is not related to the specific filed. But it is something relevant to the previous filed. Using Cypress (`cy.get('selector').type('text')`) I am able to type the proper value into one field and then when I try to enter the text into another text, mentioned issue is occurred. I have checked with changing the order of the text box and found that it is not specific to the particular field.
Also to note that, it is not throwing error if I try `cy.get('selector').clear()`.",bug
734898555,Network automation to emulate offline mode only works with DevTools open,"You can find the tests for this in https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-recipes/pull/581

Imagine I want to test how the web app handles offline mode. I can turn the offline mode using CDP and confirm the `window.navigator.onLine` changes correctly

```js
const goOffline = () => {
  cy.log('**offline**')
  .then(() => {
    return Cypress.automation('remote:debugger:protocol',
      {
        command: 'Network.emulateNetworkConditions',
        params: {
          offline: true,
          latency: -1,
          downloadThroughput: -1,
          uploadThroughput: -1,
        },
      })
  })
}
```

```
cy.wrap(window).its('navigator.onLine').should('be.false')
```

This works.

Now imagine we actually _make_ fetch requests from the app, and in offline mode they should fail. Check this out - it works. They do fail, but only _when DevTools is open_. Once we close the DevTools, the `navigator.onLine` still changes as expected, but the network calls start all working, as if ignoring the offline mode emulation.

In the video below I run the test several times with DevTools open - it is passing as expected. But when I close the DevTools, the test fails.

731834300,Ability to obtain a stack trace with relative paths,"### What would you like?

As a preprocessor-maintainer, I would like to have the ability to programmatically obtain a stack trace with relative paths as they appear in the source map, in the test-runtime, similar to the stack traces you show upon uncaught exceptions, as shown below.

![2020-10-28-231548_5120x1440_scrot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/730419/97502573-a976ca00-1973-11eb-8f17-aac482507955.png)

As seen in the screenshot, Cypress is successfully able to determine the correct, relative location of the origin of the error.

### Why is this needed?

Let me give a bit of background information to begin with. I'm contributing to `cypress-cucumber-preprocessor`, which is a preprocessor for mimicking Cucumber behavior with Cypress. Cucumber is essentially a mapping between step definitions (regular expressions) and function bodies. If a step in your feature matches more than one definition, then an ambiguity error is thrown, containing the location of the matched definitions. This behavior is specified in their [tests](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/blob/master/features/ambiguous_step.feature).

I'm trying mimic this behavior. However, if I use eg. `stacktrace-parser` to parse `new Error().stack`, as seen [here](https://github.com/badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor/commit/865bba6), I obviously get useless output, as shown below.

```
Multiple matching step definitions for: foo
 foo - http://localhost:5000/__cypress/tests?p=cypress/integration/foo.feature:6649
 /foo/ - http://localhost:5000/__cypress/tests?p=cypress/integration/foo.feature:6649
```

If I manually import `source-map-support/register`, they get a little better.

```
Multiple matching step definitions for: foo
 foo - http://localhost:5000/__cypress/tests?p=cypress/integration/cypress/integration/step_definitions/foo.ts:3
 /foo/ - http://localhost:5000/__cypress/tests?p=cypress/integration/cypress/integration/step_definitions/foo.ts:5
```

It's not perfect though and this is due to `source-map-support` taking the source origin into consideration, which for `http://localhost:5000/__cypress/tests?p=cypress/integration/foo.feature` is `http://localhost:5000/__cypress/tests?p=cypress/integration`. This source is prefixed to all relative paths in the source maps, making the stack a bit odd.",enhancement

I want to be able to save an element text before closing popup modal to use it in assertions in later steps.
using alias in the beforeEach block doesn't work because the element is not visible/accessible yet.
Also using invoke('text') or .text() or set the value as env value leave the variable undefined because of the async behavior.

731701793,Cypress Test spec timeout threshold,"<!-- Use the template below to request a feature. Please be patient and we will respond as soon as we can. -->

### What would you like?
<!-- A clear description of the feature or enhancement wanted in Cypress -->

I would like a configurable way to specify the maximum amount of time a test spec should take in seconds.

This should be on the spec level since we use batch execution of multiple specs in a suite to optimize for overhead.

eg with:
`defaultSpecTimeout`: 50

Spec 1: 40s -> No Exception 

Spec 2: 54s -> Test Result failed and ""Test has failed due to going over maximum duration threshold""

It is critical these tests still produce results in JUNIT and we continue execution.


### Why is this needed?

We have problems with `Uber` tests being created that test multiple scenarios and edge cases, this is not a bad thing for coverage of the product but it makes test case sharding into multiple phases problematic. It also has a big problem that if the beginning of the test fails then the entire coverage is gone.

Creating a maximum spec threshold would create an upper bound for developers to follow when creating tests.

731221103,Shorthand syntax for action commands: cy.click('Login'),"<!-- Use the template below to request a feature. Please be patient and we will respond as soon as we can. -->

### What would you like?
<!-- A clear description of the feature or enhancement wanted in Cypress -->
I am inspired by CodeCeption which we use at work. 
In CodeCeption you can use this syntax:
```PHP
// Click on an element with the text ""Login""
$I->click('Login');
// Click on an element with the id ""submit_button""
$I->click('submit_button');
// Fill the field with label ""Username"" with ""Miles""
$I->fillField('Username', 'Miles');
```

A shorthand notation in Cypress could follow the following rule to achieve a similar syntax:  

**If a string is added to an action (click, type, select, ...) as the first argument, this string is read as one of:**
* **the css selector of an element (comparable with `.get()`)**
* **the textual content of an element (comparable with `.contains`)**
* **the textual content of the label `<label for=""elementname"">` of an input element**

**The action will be performed on the found element**

This way test code like this:

```javascript
cy.get('#username').type('John');
cy.get('#password').type('MySuperSecret');
cy.contains('label', 'Remember me').find('input[type=""checkbox""]').check();
cy.contains('Login').click();
```
Can be written like this:

```javascript
cy.type('Username:', 'John');
cy.type('Password', 'MySuperSecret');
cy.check('Remember me');
cy.click('Login');
```

729980369,Yield context to test functions,"### What would you like?

Yield context as the first argument to a test function, much like `this` is bound to non-arrow functions `function() {}`.

e.g.

```js
it(""uses this to get aliases"", function() {
  console.log(this.myAlias);
});

it(""uses context argument to get aliases"", context => {
  // context is the same thing that would have been bound
  // to `this` if the test body was not an arrow function.
  console.log(context.myAlias); 
});
```

### Why is this needed?

Currently the only way to get the value of aliases is to use:

1. a `function() {}` style test body and use `this.myAlias`. Many people prefer not to use `this` and/or `function` syntax as they find it less descriptive.
2. `cy.get(""@myAlias"")`, which has the potential to introduce a lot of nesting tests with a lot of aliases.

I believe part of this issue (related to aliases, but not to selectors) covers these concerns: https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1417

Given that nothing appears(?) to be passed as an argument to test functions now, I think this should be fully backwards compatible.",enhancement

### Current behavior
I have a few tests that I'd like to share some network stubs.  My first thought was to use `before`:

```js
context('Context', () => {
  before(() => {
    cy.route2(...)
  })

  it('test a', () => {
    doSomethingThatShouldTriggerStub()
    // stub is triggered
  })

  it('test b', () => {
    doSomethingThatShouldTriggerStub()
    // stub is not triggered
  })
})
```

But the stubbed route isn't getting triggered on the 2nd test.  I wasn't sure if that was intentional but I assumed it was either intentional or WIP and moved to `beforeEach`:

```js
context('Context', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    cy.route2(...)
  })
  ...
})
```

`beforeEach` solved the problem with the stubs only working on the first test, but seemed to create a sort of race condition; (I think) when a stubbed request happens in between tests.  (e.g. if the app is polling in the background)

https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/052892d79f95f9792e00d426722a9d904b572df4/packages/driver/src/cy/net-stubbing/events/response-received.ts#L45-L51

### Confusing things
Easy for me to imagine this is all my user error, but a few confusing things:

* The error message is a bit confusing, as the errors seem to be coming from cypress code (though obviously caused by my test code)
* The error seems to leak into other commands like `click` shown above, even though it seems to be coming from the network stubbing.
* The error was also sometimes causing `click` to fail silently (cypress said it had clicked, but didn't perform the click).  This seems to happen if the error occurs in between the ""actionability"" checks.

`state('error')` was returning the stubbing error, and `click` was then failing silently (the cypress UI says it completed, but there's no click)

https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/052892d79f95f9792e00d426722a9d904b572df4/packages/driver/src/cy/retries.js#L101

<!-- A description including screenshots, stack traces, DEBUG logs, etc. See our Troubleshooting Guide: https://on.cypress.io/troubleshooting-->

### Desired behavior
* Ideally I'd like to be able to define stubs for a set of tests in the `before` hook.
* If that's not possible or intended, it would be nice if there was a way to prevent these errors.  (It would be pretty simple to initialize `continueSent` earlier and put a null check around `request.response=`, but I obviously don't understand the code remotely well enough to know if that creates other issues :)
* Or if this is outside the intended usage, might be nice if the error exploded things more (like if you try to run `cy.etc` outside a test)

### Test code to reproduce
<!-- Provide test code that we can copy, paste, and run on our machine to see the issue. -->
Because of the finicky timing, I was unable to get a consistent minimal repro, but this repros about 50% of the time for me.  The crux seems to be that the app fires off a stubbed request in between the tests.

### ""App""
```html
<div data-cy=""buttons"">
  <button id=""aa"">button aa</button>
  <button id=""bb"">button bb</button>
  <button id=""cc"">button cc</button>
  <button id=""clear"">clear</button>
</div>
<div id=""result"" data-cy=""result""></div>
<script>
  document.getElementById('clear').addEventListener('click', () => {
    document.getElementById('result').innerHTML = ''
  })
  ;['aa', 'bb', 'cc'].forEach((id) => {
    document.getElementById(id).addEventListener('click', async () => {
      const response = await window.fetch(`/${id}`)
      const { data } = await response.json()
      console.log('click', id, { data })

      // Fire off a bunch of extra requests to try to trigger the error
      for (let i = 0; i < 5 ; i++) {
        setTimeout(() => {
          window.fetch(`/${id}`)
        }, i * 20)
      }

      document.getElementById('result').innerHTML = data
    })
  })
</script>
```

### Test code
```js
const url = 'http://localhost:5000'

context('Trying to repro', () => {
  before(() => {
    cy.visit(url)
  })

  beforeEach(() => {
    cy.route2({ method: 'GET', pathname: /[a-z]+/ }, (req) => {
      req.reply({ data: req.url })
    })
  })
  ;['aa', 'bb'].forEach((data) => {
    it(`clicks button ${data}`, () => {
      cy.get(`#clear`).click()
      cy.get(`[data-cy=buttons]`).contains(data).click()
      cy.get(`[data-cy=result]`).contains(`${url}/${data}`)
    })
  })

### What would you like?

[`cy.request` automatically sends and sets browser cookies](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/request.html#Cookies-are-automatically-sent-and-received). I'm proposing to add an option to disable this behaviour.

Cypress.route will fail on any request that has a query param with value `http://anything`

So if you have this in cypress:

```javascript

    cy.route({
      method: ""GET"",
      url: `**/has-http-in-query-param**`,

    cy.wait(""@has-http-in-query-param"");
    cy.get(""#responseText"").contains(""ok"");
  });
});
```

...and then your app under test makes a request for `/has-http-in-query-param?x=http%3A%2F%2Fa`

Then the route *SHOULD* match but it will not

You can resume paused runs but you can't stop them or restart them from the GUI.

### Desired behavior
- Make the stop button visible to stop a paused run. 
- Make the restart button visible to restart a paused run. This would be useful if you are testing the reliability of a particular code block like what you see below. I want to run this code a few times and make sure it's behaving as expected. Having a restart button will avoid having to write temporary test (loop) code and/or spoofing code changes to trigger restarts.

```js
Cypress.Commands.add('MyCommand', (myvar1= 'value1' ) => {
    cy.visit('/')
    cy.get('#myelem1').should('have.value', 'mydomain.com')

To get around this I have to do .as('saveRequest') and then do cy.wait(). . .. several times until I hit the right request as there are lots of graphql calls going on which are only distinguishable by their operationName, once I find the one with the right operationName, then I can do the assertion I need to do in there.


### Desired behavior
As there are lots of graphql calls, it would be preferable to be able to do any required assertion within the route2 routeHandler instead.

### Test code to reproduce
```js
cy.route2(
        {
          method: 'POST',
          url: 'xxxxxxxx/graphql',
        },
        (req) => {
          const g = JSON.parse(req.body)
          if (g.operationName === 'xxxGraphqlOperationIWantToCheck') {
            expect(g.variables.someArray.length).to.equal(3); // Can see Cypress is failing this line, but the test is passing
            req.reply({
              body: {
                data: {},
              },
              headers: {
                'access-control-allow-origin': '*',
              },

717304259,Feature Request: It would be nice to be able to change a variable in the middle on an it,"### Current behavior
At the moment you are not able to change variables in the middle of an it. `newTeamId` at `cy.url()` has the value `undefined`.

### Desired behavior

It would be nice if we had a command, something like ""cy.reloadVars"", so that we can make changes and check them any time during the test. When i do `cy.url()` i would like `newTeamId` to have the value that i get from the database, since i can't get it before the it beggins because the team is not created.

### Test code to reproduce
The scenario would be something like this:
```js
describe('create a team and check the url if it has the new team id', () => {
    let newTeamId: number;
    it('should create a team and check url', () => {
        cy.xpath('createTeamButton').click();
        // after creating the team, i make a request to the database to get the new team id and store it in newTeamId
        cy.url().should('contain', `/${newTeamId}`);
    })

717243926,"Test runner ""time travel"" not working with custom elements","When trying to reproduce the problem a found the real issue here :)
Previous title: ""Test runner ""time travel"" not working""

The issue is not when using react states in a specific way (as thought earlier).

### Current behavior

The issue comes from using custom elements that are added again to the DOM when hovering a command in the test runner and the ""connectedCallback"" function, that ensures the rendering, is executed again.

#### Context

We wrap our whole application in custom elements, as we have a distributed frontend architecture that loads applications during runtime and all of that applications are custom elements. That leads to the problem, that the whole application is ""reset"" to an initial state as the whole application is rendered from scratch when the custom element is loaded in the DOM.

### Desired behavior

Also save the custom elements content when creating a DOM snapshot in a way, that does not rerender the custom element when restoring the snapshot.

### Test code to reproduce

https://github.com/chbiel/chbiel-cypress-custom-element-react-bug

run `yarn start`
then `yarn cypress:open`

712189989,OpenSSL errors when cached SSL certificates are corrupted,"<!-- Is this a question? Questions WILL BE CLOSED. Ask in our chat https://on.cypress.io/chat  -->

### Current behavior

There is a race condition in `https-proxy` that can cause the CA store to become corrupted if multiple Cypress processes are sharing the same appdata directory simultaneously. This causes errors like the following when visiting HTTPS websites:

```
Error: error:0b000074:X.509 certificate routines:OPENSSL_internal:KEY_VALUES_MISMATCH
Error: error:0900006e:PEM routines:OPENSSL_internal:NO_START_LINE
```

And other errors relating to corrupt/mismatched private keys and SSL certificates.

### Desired behavior

The race condition is avoided, probably with the addition of a lockfile when generating/writing CA certificates.

Note:  Cypress is not generally designed to run as multiple processes sharing a home directory.

### Workaround (Linux-only)

A workaround is to set a different `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` environment variable for each Cypress process that is running. This will cause each process to have its own CA store, eliminating the possibility of a race condition.

Example:

```shell
# assuming these are somehow run simultaneously
XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/tmp/cyhome1 cypress run...
XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/tmp/cyhome2 cypress run...
```

Commands seem to be central to the Cypress development experience, but with commands being all in one namespace, there is an inherent concern with overusing them.

In documentation, there doesn't seem to be any guidance around the usage of commands, or what would warrant their usage over simply importing a defined function. It would be nice to get more guidance in this regard, as we don't want to have made a bad decision from the get-go on this matter.

707989123,Manage specs groups in cypress.json,"### Feature Request
Allow to group specs in the cypress.json file


### Versions
Cypress 5.2.0

### Feature
It would be very helpful to allow arrange/categorize specs in groups in the cypress.json file.
I know it is possible to use package selectors to select test group, but not always it is possible to arrange related specs in the same package.
Sometimes there are other criteria to group tests, for example, you would like to group tests by test run duration, 
so you can split tests in more efficient way for parallel run, or any other logic.

So, instead (or additionally) of providing array in `'testFiles'` we should accept an object:

```js
""testFiles"": {
		group1: [
			""test1"",
			""test8"",
			""test3"", ],
		group2: [
			""test2"",
			""test9"",
			""test6"",],
		group3: [
			""test1"",
			""test4"",
			""test5"",]
	}
```

Then, we can run: `cypress run --record --group group2`

Once this implemented, it will be nice to have the tests in the 'cypress open' arranged in a tree view, so at development time we can select specific group.

704456850,afterEach hook is triggered after test runner was stopped.,"I can't effectively stop the interactive test runner with the stop button (black rectangle). The test stops, but the interrupted command (e.g. `cy.get()`, `cy.click()`) hits a timeout and then `afterEach` hook is triggered.

In our environment, `afterEach` hook closes the site what we are testing, so If I stop the test runner I have only some seconds (`defaultCommandTimeout`) to check the DOM elements in the debugger tools until the interrupted command times out and the site is closed. I think the test runner should stop where it is, so I can interact with the site anytime. 

For example in an environment, where there are iframes, I can't get the DOM state after the test finished, because cypress does not record it correctly. So it would be useful if I could stop the test and check the live site instead.

### Current behavior:
Stoping a `cy.get()` or `cy.click()` command will time out and trigger `afterEach` hook.

### Desired behavior:
Stoping a `cy.get()` or `cy.click()` command should not trigger `afterEach` hook, but should stop the test execution entirely.

There is a simple test code bellow. Since there is no item with the ID `#holy-grail` you can easily stop the test runner while it is trying to find that item. Try to interrupt the `cy.get()` command. It stops, but it will time out. I can see also the time out progress bar moving. After the timeout, afterEach hook is run and the test leaves the original site, so I can't interact with it.

703567423,Video recording and Screenshots are corrupted if turn on '--auto-open-devtools-for-tabs' browser option.,"### Current behavior:
Currently I need to see console during tests run on CI.
I've turned on Developer Tool via adding browser settings:

```js
    on('before:browser:launch', (browser = {}, launchOptions) => {
        if (browser.family === 'chromium') {
            // would match no browsers in 3.x
            // will match any Chromium-based browser in 4.0.0
            // ie Chrome, Canary, Chromium, Electron, Edge (Chromium-based)
            launchOptions.args.push('--auto-open-devtools-for-tabs');
            return launchOptions
        }
    })
```
But I can not see console cos videos and screenshots does NOT record Develop Tool area. Moreover all videos and screenshots are corrupted because of opened Developer Tool.

Also it would be better to have option to record all the console logs for failed tests on CI - this way there won't be necessity to open Develop Tool for running tests on CI.

702776508,Hooks should either allow config browser options or error nicely,"Cypress v5.1.0

After using `context('no firefox', {browser: '!firefox'}, () => {...})` I noticed that my `beforeEach` hook also has logic for browser filter

```js
beforeEach(() => {
  cy.task('clearDownloads')

  // The next command allow downloads in Electron, Chrome, and Edge
  // without any users popups or file save dialogs.
  if (Cypress.browser.name !== 'firefox') {
    // since this call returns a promise, must tell Cypress to wait
    // for it to be resolved
    cy.wrap(
      Cypress.automation('remote:debugger:protocol',
        {
          command: 'Page.setDownloadBehavior',
          params: { behavior: 'allow', downloadPath: downloadsFolder },
        }),
      { log: false }
    )
  }
})
```

So I foolishly thought: maybe hooks too allow filtering by browser, so I tried this

```js
beforeEach(() => {
  cy.task('clearDownloads')
})

beforeEach({ browser: '!firefox' }, () => {
  cy.wrap(
    Cypress.automation('remote:debugger:protocol',
      {
        command: 'Page.setDownloadBehavior',
        params: { behavior: 'allow', downloadPath: downloadsFolder },
      }),
    { log: false }
  )
})
```

and it tried to run in Firefox

## What I think should happen

1. It would be nice if hooks allowed filtering by browser just like suites and tests

or

2. when trying to call `beforeEach(object, hook)` it did NOT run and instead threw a nice message",enhancement

### Desired behavior:
The resolved object has type from https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/tree/develop/cli/types cypress-npm-api.d.ts

```
interface CypressFailedRunResult {

699966952,Add option to cy.intercept() to match request body,"I was trying to `cy.wait()` some specific GraphQL requests that were made using `fetch` and using `cy.route2()` but I don't see an option to add a matcher for the request body. [According to the type definition there's not `body` param](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/master/packages/net-stubbing/lib/external-types.ts#L126-L167)

The closest thing is `query` but it doesn't consider the request body. Is this by design or there are plans to add it?

### Current behavior:
All GraphQL queries go to the same endpoint ""server.com/graphql"" using the `POST` method. The query itself is sent in the request payload and it's a JSON-like string as follows:

```gql
{
  ""query"": ""query ($limit: Int) {
    searchShippingTemplate(limit: $limit) {
      shippingTemplates {
        id
      }
    }
  }"",
  ""variables"": {
    ""limit"": 25
  }
}
```

My plan was add a match for  `searchShippingTemplate` like:

```js
cy.route2({
  url: ""http://localhost:3000/graphql"",
  method: ""POST"",
  body: ""*searchShippingTemplate*"",
}).as(""getQuery"");
```

But there's no way to do that.

### Desired behavior:
Add `body` option to `RouteMatcherOptions` in order to match a string in the request body.

It would be even better to be able to pass a function (for debugging purposes) since there's no easy way to know what exactly is `.route2()` making the comparison against for each `RouteMatcherOptions` option. 

```js
cy.route2({
  url: ""http://localhost:3000/graphql"",
  method: ""POST"",
  body: (bodyString) => {
    console.log(bodyString); // In theory we could even mutate the request
    return bodyString;
  },
}).as(""getQuery"");

691677416,cy.route2 routes not being matched with external URLs,"<!-- Is this a question? Questions WILL BE CLOSED. Ask in our chat https://on.cypress.io/chat  -->

First of all, thanks for the work on `cy.route2`, it looks like it's going to make a lot of things much easier to do! I've jumped in to try it out and am having some trouble with URLs that are outside of my application (ie, API requests and such).

### Current behavior:
If the application sends a request to an external URL:

```
fetch('https://example.cypress.io/example-path')
```

In the tests, when `cy.route2` is used, it does not appear to be possible to match the request.

**Specifying `path`:**

```
cy.route2({ path: '/example-path', method: 'GET' }, { fixture: 'example.json' }).as('example');

### Current behavior:

We have the following config option

Option | Default | Description
-- | -- | --
screenshotsFolder | cypress/screenshots | Path to folder where screenshots will be saved from cy.screenshot() command or after a test fails during cypress run

The trouble is that screenshots after failure are different than screenshots taken during a test. Failure reports are test artifacts that don't get checked into source control, but `cy.screenshot()` calls should be under source control so they appear in pull requests for review.


### Desired behavior:

`cy.screenshot()` would write files in a (configurable) directory next to the test file that generated the screenshot, similar to Jest snapshots. (`__screenshots__/my_test__it_should_look_good_1.png`)

Alternatively, you could use a static location for screenshots, but keep failure screenshots and videos separate in .gitignore-able location (say `cypress/failure/screenshots|videos` by default)

Stubs configured with `cy.route()` are ignored by`<img>` and `<a>` tags on the page.

I have an chrome extension which will pick the page URL based on the window object of the current active tab. Extension is working as expected in normal usage, but when I try to execute the same with Cypress some of the internal network calls are failing and make the extension non functional. As per our RCA this is all happening cause Cypress navigates to a different URL, as its test run within an i frame with a specifically defined URL. These URLs do not match and thus cause an error when trying to retrieve data from the APIs.

688699599,.clear() isn't really an alias for .type('{selectall}{backspace}'),"<!-- Is this a question? Questions WILL BE CLOSED. Ask in our chat https://on.cypress.io/chat  -->
The `.clear()` command isn't an alias to `.type('{selectall}{backspace}')` since it doesn't behave the same. Since cypress 3.5 it's possible to type in any DOM element and if a typeable element gains focus during `.type()` then cypress continues in that one. So if you `.get()` a parent element of a typeable one, then `.clear()` should work because it's supposed to be an alias to `.type('{selectall}{backspace}')` as stated in [the docs](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/clear.html#Syntax).

```
cy.clear() failed because it requires a valid clearable element.

The element cleared was:

  > <div id=""search-input-wrap"" class=""on"">...</div>

A clearable element matches one of the following selectors:
  'a[href]'
  'area[href]'
  'input'
  'select'
  'textarea'
  'button'
  'iframe'
  '[tabindex]'
  '[contenteditable]'

```


### Current behavior:
`.clear()` doesn't have the same behavior as `.type('{selectall}{backspace}')`

cy.get('.shadow-root').find('.in-shadow-dom', { includeShadowDom: true })

### Desired behavior:

Enable configuring shadow dom inclusion globally, per-suite, per-test, or programmatically. Still need to decide on a name for it.

_cypress.json_

Turns on inclusion behavior for all tests

```json
{
  ""includeShadowDom"": true

Turns on inclusion behavior for all commands within the test

```javascript
it('shadow dom tests', { includeShadowDom: true }, () => {

683387592,Add an easy way (on the final report with all the specs) to see the retries tests. ,"### Current behavior:
On the new release 5.0 the retries functionality was added and it works really great. I would love an easy way to see how many tests needed a retry (not the number of retries I have set but the current test failures that needed a retry) on the final report. The only way I have it now is to look on the logs for the screenshots (or have a look on the report folder) and see how many screenshots were done to know exactly the number of tests that failed on the first attempt. 

### Desired behavior:
It will be great to add an extra column or just a note at the end with the tests failed that needed retries. 

### Test code to reproduce
Any project with the new version applied and the retries functionality active on the run mode.

682774494,Remove .then wrap from return value of Cypress.Blob.base64StringToBlob,"<!-- Is this a question? Questions WILL BE CLOSED. Ask in our chat https://on.cypress.io/chat  -->

### Current behavior:
We added a `.then` method to the return value of `Cypress.Blob.base64StringToBlob` so we could improve the error message when a user attempts to use its old promise-returning API (see [this comment](https://github.com/abramenal/cypress-file-upload/pull/215#issuecomment-677520674)). This causes methods like `Promise.resolve` and `Promise.try` to think the return value is a `thenable`, invoking the `.then` and throwing our error. This makes it [difficult to add backwards compatibility](https://github.com/abramenal/cypress-file-upload/pull/215) without an ugly hack.

### Desired behavior:
We shouldn't add on the `.then` method so that the return value is not mistaken for a promise-returning value. This may just result in a `.then is not a function` error when using the old API, but that might not be so bad.

### Test code to reproduce
```javascript
it('uses Cypress.Blob.base64StringToBlob', () => {
  return Cypress.Promise.resolve(Cypress.Blob.base64StringToBlob(btoa('foo')))
})

Now I'm experiencing similar issue in 5.0.0 version.

681846649,Retry mechanism of 'should' can erroneously cause the arguments to .should() to be null when cy.log() in fn,"### Current behaviour:
If I want to assert an element doesn't exist in the DOM, I have the option of simply doing something like:
```js
cy.get('#notFound').should('not exist');
```

However, in the logging, this simply returns a rather crude `Expected null not to exist`. In my view, a better way of doing the assertion is:
```js
cy.get('#notFound').should((elem) => {expect(elem).to.not.exist})
```

Which produces a log of `Expected #notFound to not exist` - which is far more informative.

However, I've discovered that if I then try and do more within the 'should' block, Cypress fails, reporting that it DID expect to find the element:

```js
cy.get('#notFound').should((elem) => {expect(elem).to.not.exist; cy.log('As we thought, it is not there')})
```

This produces 'Timed out retrying: Expected to find element: #notFound , but never found it.'

Similarly, the following works:
```js
cy.get('#thisElemIsFound').should((elem) => {expect(elem).to.exist})
```

Yet the following returns 'expected null to exist'
```js
cy.get('#thisElemIsFound').should((elem) => {expect(elem).to.exist; cy.log('As we thought, it is there')})
```

### Desired behavior:

All the following statements should pass - the only difference being, the last two should produce the `cy.log` statements. In summary, it should be possible to do more than just a simple expect statement within the should block.

```js
cy.get('#notFound').should((elem) => {expect(elem).to.not.exist;})
cy.get('#thisElemIsFound').should((elem) => {expect(elem).to.exist;})
cy.get('#notFound').should((elem) => {expect(elem).to.not.exist; cy.log('As we thought, it is not there')})
cy.get('#thisElemIsFound').should((elem) => {expect(elem).to.exist; cy.log('As we thought, it is there')})

680355190,"Add `session` API for snapshotting/restoring session related data (cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage)","## Summary

We would like to implement solutions for authentication and switching between user sessions.

To accomplish those objectives, we need to save checkpoints that represent the browser’s state at the end of some steps the user has performed. After saving the state we will be able to go back and forth between points in time.

For the time being we will call this a **Session**, though the name is up for debate.

---

Currently, if your tests rely on having set session related data (e.g. cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage), you have two choices:

- ""build up"" session data through UI interactions (similar to Page Object Pattern). For multiple tests that use the same session data, this leads to either slower tests (steps done in `beforeEach` every test) or leads to tests that can't run in isolation (requiring previous tests to build up state).
- use `cy.request`/`cy.setCookie` to programmatically set session data. For multiple tests, this reduces execution time drastically compared to Page Object Pattern. However this requires more knowledge about your app's auth to setup, can potentially be a maintenance burden, and covers less your app.

`cy.session` is meant to merge the simplicity of Page-Object-Pattern to the execution speed of programmatic auth. With `cy.session`, you'll be able to perform UI interactions before taking a ""snapshot"" of all the session related data and ""restore"" it before each test. 


## Proposal

### Defining a Session 
Sessions should be defined at the root level of your Cypress project, within `cypress/sessions.js`. A best practice is to define all of your sessions here instead of in individual spec files.

### Defining a Single Session

The proposed API for defining a single Session looks like this:

```ts
export const admin = cy.defineSession({
  name: 'admin',
  steps() {
    cy.get('#username').type('my-username')
    cy.get('#password').type('my-password')
    cy.get('#login').click()
  },
})
```

### Defining Multiple Sessions

Some alternate syntaxes utilize a `Cypress.defineSessions()` method to add many sessions at once. The keys in this object are the session names, and the value can either be a function or a Session Object.

```ts
// The keys in this map to session names
// The values may either be Session object or a Steps function
export const sessions = cy.defineSessions({
  admin() {
    cy.get('#username').type('admin-username')
    cy.get('#password').type('admin-password')
    cy.get('#login').click()
  },
  regularUser: {
    steps() {
      cy.get('#username').type('basic-username')
      cy.get('#password').type('basic-password')
      cy.get('#login').click()
    }
  }
}
```

### Assuming a Session

Assuming a session will be done in either a `beforeEach` or within a block (`it`/`describe`), so that each test starts from a single session, or programmatically whenever a user wants.

There are two ways to assume a session. One takes advantage of per-test configuration and the other is a method on the `cy` object. The API design goal is for sessions to be real Type-able objects that can be used. We will still support string-lookup of sessions by name, but using real JavaScript objects is preferred.

### Programmatic API

By reference

```ts
import { admin } from './sessions'

// Switch between sessions programmatically using the Session's object
cy.useSession(admin)

// Remove previous state, rebuild and then use the session
cy.useSession(admin, { fresh: true })
```

By string
```ts
// Switch between sessions programmatically using Session.name
cy.useSession('admin')
```
Per-test configuration
By reference

```ts
import { admin } from './sessions'
describe('As an administrator', { session: admin }, () => {
  /* ... */
})
By string
describe('As an administrator', { session: 'admin' }, () => {
  /* ... */
})
```
### Retrying Corrupt Sessions

When assuming a session throws an error, it is considered corrupt. Sessions may be corrupt for a number of reasons: Bugs in the Steps logic, corrupt state from previous tests, invalid login tokens, or general flake.

If this happens, the session’s internal state will be invalidated, and it will be rebuilt from scratch. After this, the test run will proceed as normal.

### Composition with Sessions

Because sessions are simply a set of steps and a starting state, it is possible to compose with them by reusing `cy.useSession`

To create a new user with many cart items, you’d do

```ts
const seedDb = () => cy.task('create:user')

// prefer by-function steps because adding onto
// state will possibly pollute any backends
const loginSteps = () => { /* login steps */ }
export const newUser = cy.defineSession({
  steps() {
    //  seedDb()
    /* signup */
    loginSteps
  },
  before() { seedDb() } // always exec
})

export const userWithItems = cy.defineSession({
  steps() {
    loginSteps()
    // add an item to the cart, etc
  } 
})
```

Or to create a user who opts out of tracking before signing up, you’d do: 
	
```ts
export const privacyConsciousUser = cy.defineSession({
  steps() {
    // opt out of setting cookies
    // This assumes the backend or cookies would persist this info
    // window state is NOT stored with the session.
    cy.window()
      .then((win) => win.optOut = true)

    cy.useSession(newUser)
  }
})
```

The combined state at the end of the steps function is stored as that Session’s state

680136170,Add configuration option to disable/enable multiple commands logging,"This issue relates to the #3087

### Current behavior:

I have many commands that are not desired to be logged: setting states, clearing fields, etc. Mostly it relates to the negative cases when I do smth repeatable. For example,  iterate through the array with invalid characters and type them into the input field: 

```js
cy.get('@fullname').then(input => {
  credentials.invalid.fullname.IncorrectSymbolsArray.forEach((incorrectSymbol) => {
    cy.wrap(input, { log: false }).clear({ log: false }).type(`${credentials.valid.fullname.default}${incorrectSymbol}`)
  });
}).clear({ log: false })
```
_(some assertions will be added)_

In this case, if logging is not turned off, the left side log looks very ""crowded"".  I need information only about characters that are typed.

So, about 70% of commands have `{log: false}` option in my tests. It takes time to add this option and code looks not so pretty.
<!-- A description including screenshots, stack traces, DEBUG logs, etc -->

### Desired behavior:

I have a proposition:

1. Provide a global logging setting in the configuration file. By default, it should be true.
2. Provide `{log: }` option for `context()` and `it().`
3. Priority order: command() > it() > context() > global configuration

So, then users have the ability to enable/disable logging in different scopes.

and then I try to click the green **Start Workout** button. 

However, when I do `cy.get('.button').contains('Start Workout').click()`, Cypress scrolls to here:

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/911671/90334609-e0585900-df9c-11ea-9477-ebb611a3e902.png)

where the button is barely visible.

So when I try to do a standard click, I get:

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/911671/90334687-72f8f800-df9d-11ea-9515-bff14788fcdb.png)

I believe that this is probably due to the navbar changing size during the scroll, as can be seen from the images. However, as can be seen from the first image, no scrolling is needed to click the button.

I tried several workarounds without success, including scrolling manually before the `click`. It seems that the `click` itself is trying to scroll to the element, offsetting it from the visible area. The only workaround that worked was the following:

```js
cy.get('.button')
  .contains('Start Workout')
  .click('bottom')
```

since the bottom edge of the button is still visible.

### Desired behavior:
It would be nice to not have to click an edge of a button during tests, especially when no scrolling is necessary. If the test could pass with:

```js
cy.get('.button')
  .contains('Start Workout')
  .click()
```

that would be great.

Bug report

- version: Cypress: 4.12.1, node: 12.18.3, cypress-vue-unit-test: master (ec529fafe769df0020241253af948800b95bf28d)
- platform: macOS Catalina
- expected behavior: Running cypress in headless mode should run tests successfully

First off, I'd just like to say I think this is a fantastic project! I've previously abhorred writing component tests using vue-test-utils & vue-testing-library. This library has actually made frontend development enjoyable! So, thanks for creating this experiment - it's working really well for us so far.

We're trying to put our component tests in CI, but are having trouble running them in headless mode even on dev machines. It builds the source in webpack successfully, then just sits there for a couple of minutes before finally crashing with a pretty opaque (to me) error:

```
1) An uncaught error was detected outside of a test:
     Error: The following error originated from your test code, not from Cypress.

  > Fetching resource at '/__cypress/tests?p=cypress/support/index.ts' failed

When Cypress detects uncaught errors originating from your test code it will automatically fail the current test.

Cypress could not associate this error to any specific test.

We dynamically generated a new test to display this failure.
      at XMLHttpRequest.xhr.onerror (http://localhost:57131/__cypress/runner/cypress_runner.js:172391:14)
```

Happens with both our own project (using version 3.5.1) and in the cli-ts example in this repo on master.

If someone is able to point me in the right direction I'm happy to do some digging and try and fix this!

Here is my piece of code:
```js
before(function () {
  Cypress.config(""defaultCommandTimeout"", 20000);

What I am trying to achieve is set the default command time out to 20 secs because my nextJS application takes more than the usual time during CI to load the content of the page.

Once the page is loaded, I expect Cypress to respect the timeout that I set, but it continues to wait for just 4sec which is the default time out. Refer to below screenshots.

- install dependencies: `npm install`
- open Cypress runner : `npm run cy:open`
- choose Chrome as the browser
- execute test : `pdfExport.spec.js`

- `Test#2` will fail because the downloaded PDF file is blank which is what this issue is all about

Problem: 

When the above steps are executed in Cypress, it downloads a blank PDF file:  `/cypress/downloads/SlypReceipt.pdf`
When manually downloaded, you get the correct PDF file: `/cypress/downloads/SlypReceipt_Working.pdf`

Actual Result: Cypress downloads a blank PDF

Currently the search pattern does not allow the use of Regular Expressions.

### Desired behavior:

Since I have spec files created for individual brand tests in separate files within separate folders it would be very useful to be able to filter using a regular expression (using the folder separator and maybe include a dropdown to specify .spec.ts, .spec.js, etc.) so I can include the folder(s) and/or sub folder(s) that the spec files exist in.

Simply include a regular expression in the search pattern (include a back slack or forward slash or asterisks).

Which was recently changed in the last month. However, when running cypress with the `--parallel` flag in this environment cypress (`4.11`) puts out this error:

```

662619049,Do not pin CLI dependencies,"### Current behavior:
Currently, Cypress pins all dependencies. Previously we had preferred locking dependencies since we ran into issues before without locking, but since migrating to `yarn` for our own dev work, I've been told these concerns are more minimal.

```json
""lodash"": ""4.17.19""
```

**This introduces some issues:**

1. If there is a security vulnerability from a dep of Cypress found (highlighted through `npm audit`), our users are unable to run `npm audit fix` to bump the dependency themselves. This requires the user to use a convoluted workaround or for Cypress to release a new version - pushing a hotfix or waiting potentially 2 weeks for the scheduled release. 

    Many of our users have rules around their builds/dev process not allowing them to move forward if `npm audit` fails, so this presents an issue for them. ```**See previous issues:**``````* lodash security vulnerability: https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7921* minimist security vulnerability: https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6793* another lodash security vulnerability: https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4743```

1. Our pinning strategy and how we run yarn + npm when building the binary is contributing to an increase in size of the binary. Sometimes there are dupped dependencies included. 

```

**See previous issues:**

```

```

* Fix lodash dup dep: https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/7954
* Built zip size keeps increasing: https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5977 

    ### Desired behavior:
    Have looser restrictions on dependencies of Cypress, while using the correct dependencies to also build the binary.
    
    ```json
    ""lodash"": ""^4.17.19""* Renovate should be able to handle the enforcement of our range strategy mostly: https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#rangestrategy* Look into how `npm` is run to build the binary.### Versions4.10.0",enhancement

### Current behavior:

Calling screenshot on an element that is scaled to be larger than the viewport produces a screenshot that is not reflective of what the user actually sees. It properly cuts off at the bottom of the screen, but duplicates parts of the screen at the top.

Here's an example:

```html
<html>
<body>
<main style=""transform: scaleY(10); background: linear-gradient(yellow, blue, red); height: 50vh; transition: 10s;""></main>
</body>

```javascript

### Desired behavior:

Calling `screenshot()` should produce the correct screenshot. Currently, with this test case calling `cy.screenshot()` (the full page screenshot) will produce the correct screenshot that appears as follows. Calling screenshot on `main` should produce a similar result (without padding):

This actually *is* possible today, although it's undocumented using the method below. 

```js
Cypress.automation(""remote:debugger:protocol"", {

})
```

### Desired behavior:

People have requested that they'd like direct access to the Chrome DevTools Protocol. Would want this documented so people could use it. Some examples of usage are below:

- Passing locale: https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7890#issuecomment-655174901
- SessionId request: https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7256
- Emulating offline mode: https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/235#issuecomment-608367340

This feature needs to support:

- Issuing commands
- Receiving events

Additionally, there's no cross-browser support to this, so that's a challenge.

### Versions

654416558,Allow custom metadata to enable integration with test management system?,"<!-- Is this a question? Questions WILL BE CLOSED. Ask in our chat https://on.cypress.io/chat  -->

### Current behavior:
No way to add custom metadata to test cases/files that allows users to further process the test results.
An example would be tagging test case with ticket number in a test management tool so later user can sync test result under the test ticket.
<!-- A description including screenshots, stack traces, DEBUG logs, etc -->

### Desired behavior:
Some sort of tagging system that can be carried to test execution result reporting file(s)
<!-- A clear description of what you want to happen -->

### Test code to reproduce

<!-- If we cannot fully run the tests as provided the issue WILL BE CLOSED -->
<!-- Issues without a reproducible example WILL BE CLOSED -->

<!-- You can fork https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-test-tiny repo, set up a failing test, then link to your fork -->

### Versions

### Desired behavior:

Should not crush...

### Test code to reproduce

N/A


### Versions

4.10.0

I can run my tests several times before it crashes.
This started when upgrade to 4.10.0. No changes to the tests since 4.9.0.
",bug
653991730,Angular Component Harness (Test Harness) support in Cypress,"<!-- Is this a question? Questions WILL BE CLOSED. Ask in our chat https://on.cypress.io/chat  -->

### Current behavior:
Cypress based e2e test cases  are not supporting angular [Component Harness](https://material.angular.io/cdk/test-harnesses/overview) (Test Harness).

### Desired behavior:

Cypress e2e tests shall be able to utilize angular component(test) harness. **_CypressElement_** and **_CypressHarnessEnvironment_** shall be available similar to [ProtractorElement](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/master/src/cdk/testing/protractor/protractor-element.ts) and [ProtractorHarnessEnvironment](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/master/src/cdk/testing/protractor/protractor-harness-environment.ts).

### Test code to reproduce
After **_CypressElement_** and **_CypressHarnessEnvironment_** is available, the user shall be able to use harness test cases in cypress e2e like:

```javascript
 it('should get button label from button harness', async () => {
    harnessLoader = CypressHarnessEnvironment.loader();
    const ButtonHarness = harnessLoader.getHarness(ButtonTestHarness);
    (await ButtonHarness).ButtonLabel().then(async (value) => {
      expect(value).toEqual('label');
    });
  });
```
### Why we need this feature
Currently, our e2e test cases are using Cypress. In order to use test harness APIs provided by UI library in our e2e, we need support from cypress.



Please let me know if there is any plan to support angular test harness.

652788505,Timeout progress bar reset when hooks collapsed,"<!-- Is this a question? Questions WILL BE CLOSED. Ask in our chat https://on.cypress.io/chat  -->

### Current behavior:
The timeout progress bar will not maintain state when a hook is collapsed and then reopened. This also occurs for opening and closing suites, but not tests (closing a test actually prevents the content from rendering in the DOM, rather than just hiding it).

![ezgif-6-7b5bfe0add82](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7033952/86860732-68d90500-c093-11ea-8d26-a5d2cf6d2671.gif)

### Desired behavior:
The progress bar should reflect the actual progress made and continue to progress as if it was never opened or closed (the same thing that happens with test).

652569796,How to properly fail a test?,"In web frameworks there is often an error handler that catches internal errors. For example in Vue there is

```js
Vue.config.errorHandler = (err, vm, info) => {
  ...
}
```

How can we fail a running test if an error is caught this way? The only solution I found was to do the following

```js
// exclude these lines from code coverage
/* istanbul ignore next */
if (window.Cypress) {
  // send any errors caught by the Vue handler
  // to the Cypress top level error handler to fail the test
  Vue.config.errorHandler = window.top.onerror
}
```

But there has to be a better way

Enabling the `experimentalSourceRewriting` setting breaks tests for a React app with `react-router` (https://reactrouter.com). Any test with a `cy.visit` runs for several seconds before timing out:

**Investigation**

It looks like the rewrite changes the code in history.js:

```js
function createLocation(path, state, key, currentLocation) {
  var location;

  if (typeof path === 'string') {
    // Two-arg form: push(path, state)
    location = parsePath(path); // THIS LINE GETS REWRITTEN TO gobalThis.Cypress.XXXX = parsePath(path);
    location.state = state; // Because of rewrite location will be undefined here...
  } else {

...

### Desired behavior:

<!-- A clear description of what you want to happen -->

A React app with react-router can be tested with `experimentalSourceRewriting` turned on. I think the experiment fixes another issue I have in my application (not showcased in linked cypress-test-tiny fork).

It's unclear to me if the rewrite is being too aggressive and should leave the code in history.js alone, or if it's not aggressive enough and it should be rewriting all the `location` references :)

First of all: thank you for your work on Cypress 🙏. It's awesome and such a pleasure to use!

---

### Current behavior:

I have no unified, platform-independent way of controlling the browser locale. Setting it is specific to the browser and platform and thus error prone.

<!-- A description including screenshots, stack traces, DEBUG logs, etc -->

### Desired behavior:

My goal is to get a predictable output of `new Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions()`. I'm on macOS and I haven't found a way to set the browser locale in Chrome. It always resolves to `locale: ""en-GB""` but it should resolve to `en-US`. I tried setting the `LANGUAGE`, `LANG`, `LC_ALL` environment variables but it seems like they are ignored or overwritten. I also tried the `--lang` argument but that doesn't work as well (I read that it's only supported on Windows).

I also tried setting

- `launchOptions.preferences.default[""settings.language.preferred_languages""]`
- `launchOptions.preferences.default[""intl.initial_locale""]`
- `launchOptions.preferences.localState[""variations_safe_seed_locale""]`

during `'before:browser:launch'` but with no luck.

To be honest, I didn't even get Chrome to start from the command line with the correct locale. I tried it with this command:

`LANGUAGE=en-US LANG=en-US LC_ALL=en-US ./""Google Chrome"" --user-data-dir=""~/temp"" --lang=""en""`

So this is probably also kind of a Chrome issue.

I saw that Cypress is using a dedicated user profile located in `~/Library/Application Support/Cypress/cy/production/browsers/chrome-stable/interactive/Default`. Maybe it needs to be set somewhere there...

In this issue I'm asking for two things:

- In case you know a way how to set the Chrome locale or even in case you know that this is still an unsolved issue, could you please document this in this issue? I think this could be a common problem since a lot of web developers are on macOS.

- It would be nice if Cypress offered an easy, cross-platform configuration for setting the browser locale. There is a [similar request for the timezone](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1043) and I think this is quite common: you want to control the locale *and* the timezone your tests are executed with. (Btw: setting the `TZ` env variable works fine).

650253854,"""Cannot set property 'err' of undefined"" error occurs in place of other errors during automatic test-reruns on file save.","### Current behavior:
When running tests locally through `cypress open`, and when interrupting tests by saving files (forcing a re-run), any failures occurred during the run can trigger this message:

```
The following error originated from your application code, not from Cypress.

  > Cannot set property 'err' of undefined

When Cypress detects uncaught errors originating from your application it will automatically fail the current test.

This behavior is configurable, and you can choose to turn this off by listening to the uncaught:exception event. Learn more
```

The error is not really originating from the application; it's occurring within `hookFailed` at https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/4cfcae28f097e013ffe7dc7419905eccf1022709/packages/driver/src/cypress/runner.js#L526. Both `getTest()` and `getTestFromHookOrFindTest(hook)` end up returning `undefined`.

I've seen this on two very different projects.

* At work, which is a custom server + Webpack setup, webpack/React, running on MacOS.
* At home, on a personal project running Next.js, running on Windows (Powershell). This project is linked below.

### Desired behavior:
The test fails with the normal readable stack trace.

### Test code to reproduce
This is easily reproducible on this project (created a branch with a failing spec):
https://github.com/primitiveconcept/ludumdare46/tree/cypress/err-of-undefined/client

* Run `npm run cy:dev` for server + Cypress
* Run the `filesystem.spec.ts` spec
* Save the `filesystem.spec.ts` while the test is running. Reproduces around 25% of the time, may require a few tries.

If needed, I can try to come up with a minimal reproduction, but this isn't a very complex project. The server isn't required for the tests.

This actually requires the fix from https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/7862 before it's evident (without this fix the click throws Illegal Invocation error). 

When you click on an element within an iframe that has a global parent defined, the click coordinates are not drawn in the correct spot.

This is due to `autFrame.scrollY` and `autFrame.scrollX` being undefined here:

https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/develop/packages/driver/src/dom/coordinates.js#L122:L122

Since it's grabbing the wrong `window.parent` and setting it as the `autFrame` here

https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/develop/packages/driver/src/dom/coordinates.js#L78:L78

### Desired behavior:

648713783,Actions in Cypress cause Failed to execute 'getComputedStyle' on 'Window': parameter 1 is not of type 'Element',"### Current behavior:
When using Cypress to click through the [Norwegian BankID test page](https://www.bankid.no/privat/los-mitt-bankid-problem/test-din-bankid---multidokumentsignering/) (the most commonly used electronic identification system in Norway) it's not possible to type in the input fields within the iframes without using `{ force: true }`. The iframe is cross-origin, so we have disabled `chromeWebSecurity` in `cypress.json`. It's worth noting that the input field is inside an iframe which itself is inside an iframe, where the inner iframe is from the source csfe.bankid.no and the outer is from the source tools.bankid.no.

When using `{ force: true }` it still does not emit all the events that a proper user keyboard action would, as the website behaves differently than when manually typing in the input field. When manually typing, the form validator is run which enables form submit, but this does not happen when typing using Cypress and `cy.type`. If trying to type without `{ force: true }` we get an error saying `Timed out retrying: Failed to execute 'getComputedStyle' on 'Window': parameter 1 is not of type 'Element'.`.

### Desired behavior:
Using `cy.type` (either with or without `{ force: true }`) leads to the same result as when a user would type into the field. That is, the validator runs and the submit is enabled.

### Test code to reproduce
- I have forked the cypress-test-tiny repo to make a reproducible example: https://github.com/torkjels/cypress-test-tiny.
- Run the tests non-headless in Chrome using `npm run cypress:open`.
- There are 4 tests, and the only one that runs green is the one that pauses to allow for a user keyboard action. This suggests that there are some event(s)/information that `cy.type` doesn't emit to the iframe which get dispatched on normal user interaction.

**_My Two Cents_**

We should remove the `focus` state when clicking and only leave it for keyboard navigation like we do with the [print to console button](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/715d07c1a9308ad215fe35da2775100a31dbf982/packages/reporter/src/errors/test-error.tsx#L81-L88). In addition, the focus state for keyboard navigation should be the same as the hover state, and not include an outline around the name. The keyboard controls are fairly standard for the browser and don't require a change, but I figured I would include them to provide a broader picture (perhaps we could also add additional keyboard shortcuts).

This is more an exploration and a question, not a bug

In https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-movie/issues/9 I am trying to take a viewport of an application that has already been set to take over the entire window

```js
cy.screenshot('finish', { capture: 'viewport' })
```

The window size is 1920x1080 and the application under test has been set to cover the entire thing (hiding the command log and the navigation bar)

```js
 Cypress.Commands.add(""clearViewport"", () => { 
   const runnerContainer = window.parent.document.getElementsByClassName( 
     ""iframes-container"" 
   )[0]; 
   runnerContainer.setAttribute( 
     ""style"", 
     ""left: 0; top: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"" 
   ); 
  
   const sizeContainer = window.parent.document.getElementsByClassName( 
     ""size-container""

   sizeContainer.setAttribute(""style"", """"); 
  
   const sidebar = window.parent.document.getElementsByClassName(

644327048,Bug: Cypress hangs when detecting element visibility with Shadow DOM enabled,"<!-- Is this a question? Questions WILL BE CLOSED. Ask in our chat https://on.cypress.io/chat  -->

### Current behavior:

<!-- A description including screenshots, stack traces, DEBUG logs, etc -->

It is the same or similar as #7679 (fixed in #7692), except this is _with_ `experimentalShadowDomSupport: true` and using Ionic (which heavily uses Shadow DOM).

Essentially when Cypress attempts to detect visibility of an Ionic component where there's a modal backdrop visible, it seems to go into an endless loop of that same find element code path.

**Note:** Also, notice how it thinks the `ion-button` is invisible. I think this is a separate regression/issue because I've seen this in other tests for Ionic popovers/toasts where it thinks it's not visible when they really are.

### Desired behavior:

<!-- A clear description of what you want to happen -->
Interacting with Ionic components shouldn't cause Cypress to hang.

I think that `while` loop may be due for a ""max loop"" check because it seems like we really don't want Cypress to totally hang under any circumstances. For example, this bug is causing my CI to generate 7GB video files, unless I force-stop the build/workflow.

I have a custom video player that I need to test the various elements of the player controls.

I'm showing below with Youtube just to show it's not an isolated issue in my environment.

The tests below show the problem/solution in the firefox browser ran locally in the test runner (workaround doesn't work in ci environment for me). The behavior is similar in other browsers, but it was harder to hack fix in a concise way inside a test for demonstration purposes. In Chrome, for example, `fullscreenEnabled` is set to true, making the fullscreen button clickable, but the fullscreen action is still denied. I can mimic the same solution in chrome by manually adding the `allowfullscreen` attr. and then reloading the iframe via js in the console.

The first test fails because the `fullscreenEnabled` property is false. The second test will pass because I am programmatically adding the `allowfullscreen` attr., reloading the iframe, then running the tests.

640638962,Bug:  Modifying the `Cypress.SelectorPlayground.defaults - selectorPriority` breaks the Selector Playground,"### Current behavior:
Modifying the `Cypress.SelectorPlayground.defaults` in the `support/index.js` file breaks the Selector Playground in the GUI.

### Desired behavior:
To be able to modify/add to the `selectorPriority` list and still use the Selector Playground.

### Test code to reproduce

If you modify the `cypress/support/index.js` file with this:
```js
Cypress.SelectorPlayground.defaults({
  selectorPriority: [
    ""data-qa"",
    ""data-test"",
    ""data-cy"",
    ""id"",
    ""class"",
    ""name"",
    ""tag"",
    ""attributes"",
    ""nth-child"",
  ],
});
```

The selector playground is broken and doesn't work at all.

When I comment this block of code out, the Selector Playground works normally.

This issue helped me figure out where to modify the selectorPriority:

The codebase has an unknown number of usages of this pattern:

This is problematic - in the event of a forced exit due to a signal (eg SIGKILL), the `exit` callback will be invoked with `(code = undefined, signal = 'SIGKILL')`, which will cause the parent process to exit successfully instead of with an error code.

This has the effect of making crashes much harder to detect and debug in some cases.

638061481,Allow hiding assertion logs for `.should()` and `.and()` except on failure,"### Current behavior:

There is no way to hide logs when making assertions, for example, with `should`.

### Desired behavior:

There is a way to hide passing assertions while still reporting failing assertions. Ideally these successful assertions could also be turned back on when running under a different log level.

This came up because I wanted a ""safer"" version of the `get` command, which would by default assert that there is only 1 element found (unless an explicit `length` option was passed) and that the element is visible (unless an explicit `noVisibleCheck` option was passed), since I've seen tests fail or falsely succeed because of overbroad selectors or when an element was present in the DOM but not visible. Cypress tests run fast enough that doing this shouldn't add significantly to the test run time.

However, when I do this, I end up with a ton of extra logs for each `get`, which clutters the test output. I'd like a way to disable these logs by default, unless the assertions fail.

Whenever I set ""experimentalSourceRewriting"" to true in my Env Config, Page Load keeps on loading after signing in to the page even though in the Browser window, The page has loaded completely.

it('Add Valid Company Details with Required Fields only', () => {
  var Companyname = chance.company()
  cy.log(Companyname)

  Cypress.on('window:before:load', (win) => {
    Object.defineProperty(win, 'self', {
      get: () => {
        return window.top

    })
  })

  cy.login()

  cy.get('.ins-button-options-wrap > .button-wrap > .ins-button > div > .btn__label').click()
})

Please note that I am using Chance.js to generate Strings and created a Custom Command for the whole login process.

",bug
636525262,Explore allowing `cy` command usage in `cy.intercept` callbacks,"<!-- Is this a question? Questions WILL BE CLOSED. Ask in our chat https://on.cypress.io/chat  -->

### Current behavior:
`cy` commands are not explicitly treated differently when called from inside `cy.route2` callbacks.

### Desired behavior:
Cypress generally stops users from writing non-deterministic tests, and using cy commands inside of request/response callbacks would cause non-determinism.

`cy` commands should fail when called from inside `cy.route2` callbacks with a clear error message explaining why.

Perhaps cy.now should remain, so users can have a backdoor to access Cypress commands directly

### Desired behavior:

I want to run the example tests shipped with cypress out of the box.

### Test code to reproduce

It failed with every example shipped with cypress, I just add the `window.spec.js` here, since it's the smallest file

<details><summary>window.spec.js</summary><p>

```js
/// <reference types=""cypress"" />

context('Window', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    cy.visit('https://example.cypress.io/commands/window')
  })

  it('cy.window() - get the global window object', () => {
    // https://on.cypress.io/window
    cy.window().should('have.property', 'top')
  })

  it('cy.document() - get the document object', () => {
    // https://on.cypress.io/document
    cy.document().should('have.property', 'charset').and('eq', 'UTF-8')
  })

  it('cy.title() - get the title', () => {
    // https://on.cypress.io/title
    cy.title().should('include', 'Kitchen Sink')

636375668,Add support for waiting on the Nth request/response in cy.intercept(),"<!-- Is this a question? Questions WILL BE CLOSED. Ask in our chat https://on.cypress.io/chat  -->

### Current behavior:
`cy.route` has (undocumented) support for waiting on the Nth request/response:

```js
cy.wait('@foo.1') // first response
cy.wait('@foo.request.1') // first request
cy.wait('@foo.response.5') // fifth response
```

`cy.route2` does not have this.

### Desired behavior:
Implement this in `cy.route2`, so that the following tests can pass:

636371581,Show req/res diffs in consoleProps when using cy.intercept,"<!-- Is this a question? Questions WILL BE CLOSED. Ask in our chat https://on.cypress.io/chat  -->

### Current behavior:
There is not an easy way to tell what types of transformations were applied to a request or response in `cy.route2` after the fact.

### Desired behavior:
Improve logging to show the original request/response objects, as well as their diffs to the request/response objects that were actually used.

This may rely on the under-the-hood work to keep track of taintedness in #7657

636367544,"Add throttleKbps, delayMs with presets to StaticResponse objects","<!-- Is this a question? Questions WILL BE CLOSED. Ask in our chat https://on.cypress.io/chat  -->

### Current behavior:
Users have to invoke `.delay()` or `.throttle()` to delay/throttle the response, and they have to use plain numbers (ms and kbps, respectively) to set the throttle:

https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/2443eb4276fca048260b045b57123cc17a519b2e/packages/driver/test/cypress/integration/commands/net_stubbing_spec.ts#L766-L774

### Desired behavior:
Users should be able to statically define throttleKbps or delayMs, and should be able to use string presets. So the above code could be written as this:

```js
cy.route2('/timeout', {
	statusCode: 200,
	body: payload,
	delayMs,
	throttle: '3g', 
})
```

For the list of throttle presets, we can probably use the same list that Chromium/WebKit use: https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:chrome/test/chromedriver/chrome/network_list.cc;l=12;drc=23bc3b1c92fd920d4d359ba46d73054ff0f47d2c?originalUrl=https:%2F%2Fcs.chromium.org%2F

636357321,Add Express-compatible APIs to `cy.intercept` interceptors,"<!-- Is this a question? Questions WILL BE CLOSED. Ask in our chat https://on.cypress.io/chat  -->

### Current behavior:
Intercepting requests/responses right now is pretty ugly, lots of manual object manipulation and not many helper functions to let users modify the requests/responses.

### Desired behavior:
Using the Express APIs for inspiration, implement many of the same concepts for Cypress's request/response interception. For example, a user should be able to use `res.set` to case-insensitively override a header:

```js
cy.intercept('*', (req) => {
	req.reply(res => {
		res.set('content-type', 'foo').send()
	})
})
```

636351884,Add API for skipping proxy middleware via `cy.intercept`,"Users may want to disable certain middleware in the `proxy` layer that interferes with their tests.

For example, to disable the behavior where Cypress attaches auth headers to an outgoing request:

`req.skipMiddleware('MaybeSetBasicAuthHeaders')`

And then the proxy would skip this for that request only:

https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/2443eb4276fca048260b045b57123cc17a519b2e/packages/proxy/lib/http/request-middleware.ts#L106-L117

636340183,Implement plugin events for network stubbing/spying,"It makes sense to let plugins access the same network stubbing events that the driver can access, so that users can write more complex network stubbing tasks in Node.js.

A basic implementation of this would just be to let the plugin register to receive `net` events from the `socket`:

https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/2443eb4276fca048260b045b57123cc17a519b2e/packages/net-stubbing/lib/server/driver-events.ts#L133-L148

I have also tried the same script manually and also with pupeteers but it doesn't do the same behavior.

### Desired behavior:
Do not add the iframe-request-id more than once

### Test code to reproduce
```js
describe('My test', function() {

### Current behavior:
I find all of the api of cypress about `route` and `server`, but there is no way to change the xhr request `before send`, there is only the `onRequest` callback of route method.
In a situation, my gps location is get from internet, and I know the current location of the target area.
But I can't simulation the location. The only way I find is to change the request body before send to server. I prepare the correct location and change the request to test the different cases;

May it has a callback of `beforeRequest`.

### Current behavior:

If a test fails or there is an error in a spec that has a space in its name, the following issues occur:

- The error stack does not point to the user code as it should
  - This also makes it impossible to open in IDE
- The stack line has `undefined:NaN` instead of `<line>:<column>` (_edit (7/9/20): only happens in `develop`_)
- The code frame does not display

### Desired behavior:

Errors should display properly regardless of file naming conventions.

### Test code to reproduce

- Create a spec file with a space in its name (e.g. `cypress/integration/with space_spec.js`)

628047347,Should show stack trace to step in the script on custom command error,"I'm creating set of really useful Cypress commands. I wan't to handle invalid arguments validations and more stuff within the custom command. Default Cypress `get()` command handles it as follows,

```javascript
get (selector, options = {}) {
  const userOptions = options
  const ctx = this

  if ((userOptions === null) || _.isArray(userOptions) || !_.isPlainObject(userOptions)) {

Important thing here is, the failure from `get()` will show stack trace to the current step in the **test script** as well as in the code peek window.

### Current behavior:
With current capabilities, I could throw an error from the command

```js
Cypress.Commands.add('vDo', (...args) => {
    throw new Error('testing error');
});
```
but when an error is thrown from a custom command, log will shows the stack trace to the custom command implementation, not to the current step in the script just like `get()`.

### Desired behavior:
My suggestion for handling errors would be following, since I can do it in the same format as other commands,

```js
Cypress.Commands.add('vDo', (sel, userOptions) => {
    return $errUtils.throwErrByPath('vDo.invalid_options', {
        args: {
            options: userOptions

In the log, on an error, stack trace & code peek should show the step in test script.

## Json report problem

Let's say we want to validate the tests that executed. We could try using json reporter ... but we cannot get JUST the JSON file

The user could redirect the STDOUT 

```
npx cypress run --reporter json > report.json
```

then there is NO output from the run and the report.json has a mixture of the human output and JSON parts.

### proposal

First, let's split the `json` output and output it to STDERR. Then the user at least could have nice and clean json file

```
npx cypress run --reporter json 2> report.json
```

Note: if there is an error, we write errors to STDERR, but in that case the report is invalid anyway, so I am ok with that.

## Ideally

But I really want both: human-readable spec reporter and json report for checking the tests that executed.

I think a good approach would be to allow specifying multiple reporters using `--reporter name1,name2` and saving additional reports into `cypress/reports` folder

## Why

When running component tests we use settings in cypress.json

```
experimentalComponentTesting: true,
componentFolder: ""src""
```

If we change the config key name or how they work - the tests still happily pass (because there are integration specs), yet the component tests that we really wanted to execute never ran, and there is no easy way of verifying the list of files and tests that were executed.

One could install a multi reporter module, but that is unnecessary complexity in my opinion.",enhancement

Our Jenkins is started through _LaunchDaemons_ as some specific user, which is not logged in, and therefore has no running windowserver (`SystemUIServer`, or however this thing is called nowadays).

Jenkins then launches `cypress run`, which fails with:
```
_RegisterApplication(), FAILED TO establish the default connection to the WindowServer, _CGSDefaultConnection() is NULL.
```

and later on:
```

I also noticed, when I am on my local machine, and do a `cypress run`, it pops up a Dock icon, which only has a main menu with a single _Quit_ item, and points to `~/Library/Caches/Cypress/4.6.0/Cypress.app`. I guess it shouldn't do that either.

### Workarounds

I found two workarounds:
- I switched from Electron to Chromium, and at least Chromium runs the tests, but cannot record vidoes.
- I logged in as the Jenkins user in the Console via Screen Sharing. Now Electron runs fine and does record videous. It also puts its icon into the Dock.

### Desired behavior:

Cypress and Electron should not require a UI when running in headless mode.

### To reproduce

- a Mac with two user accounts
- login as user A
- In Terminal: `sudo su - B`
- as user B, run `cypress run`

Strangely enough, in this case, simply logging in a user B as well does NOT fix the problem.

622384220,Redirect adds `__` within directory path when `experimentalSourceRewriting` is on,"<!-- Is this a question? Questions WILL BE CLOSED. Ask in our chat https://on.cypress.io/chat  -->

### Current behavior:

Current behavior:
When I login through the normal browser then I am able to log in.
But when running from cypress test runner the directory path is missing from URL.

The Cypress Test Runner redirects to: `http://:8084/__/branchHome.html`

620803690,cy.contains() reruns previous commands when re-querying an alias ,"### Current behavior:

Preconditions:
* an element is located using `cy.contains()` invoked off the `cy` object and saved as `@alias`
* the element is recreated by the application under test

If the test tries to retrieve the element using `cy.get('@alias')`, the whole chain is executed again as expected (starting with `cy.contains()`). The `cy.contains()` works fine and finds the element in the whole document.

However, if there were some querying commands before `cy.contains()`, they seem to interfere with the alias querying procedure. For instance, the alias query fails if the query command _preceding to `contains`_ does not succeed. Please see the reproduction example for more clarity

### Desired behavior:

When invoked off the `cy` object, the `contains` command should not depend in any way on the precedent command.

620447596,Cross-origin error happening on same domain after click event adds same page anchor,"### Current behavior:

Is not possible to continue with the test execution after getting error message:
```
Cypress detected a cross origin error happened on page load:
  > Blocked a frame with origin ""http://automationpractice.com"" from accessing a cross-origin frame.
Before the page load, you were bound to the origin policy:
  > http://automationpractice.com
```
This is happening when I click the create account button with a valid email (non-registered) in the email address field after visiting the site http://automationpractice.com/index.php?controller=authentication&back=my-account.

This event is not redirecting user to any new domain, actually it doesn't seem any redirection is made instead it looks like a page anchor from the same page is added to the url, loading new content in the same page and showing/hiding a few elements from the page layout.

If `chromeWebSecurity: false` is added to the the `cypress.json` file the issue continues. No error message is displayed but instead after the same event is triggered a blank page is loaded instead  blocking the test entirely.

### Desired behavior:

Cypress should be able to continue with the following step without showing the cross-origin error for this particular case.

### Test code to reproduce

1. Set up a new cypress project
2. Add a new javascript file with any desired name to the integration folder, with the following code:
```js
describe('Create Account', () => {
    it('Visit Store Website', () => {
        cy.visit('http://automationpractice.com/index.php?controller=authentication&back=my-account')
    })

    it('Add Email to create a new account', () => {
        cy.xpath('//input[@id=""email_create""]').type('faketest_1@faketestexample.com')
        cy.xpath('//form[@id=""create-account_form""]').submit()
    })

    it('Add personal information', () => {
        cy.get('.uniform-id_gender1').click()
        cy.get('.customer_firstname').type('First')
        cy.get('.customer_lastname').type('Last')
        cy.get('.passwd').type('whatever123')

        cy.get('.months').select('10')
        cy.get('.years').select('1985')

618947444,Hide XHR requests from the command log,"<!-- Is this a question? Questions WILL BE CLOSED. Ask in our chat https://on.cypress.io/chat  -->

### Current behavior:

All XHR requests are printed to the command log, which can be distracting. There is no option to filter them. In https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1184 it was mentioned this is possible by whitelisting requests with `Cypress.Server.defaults`, but that breaks stubbing.

### Desired behavior:

Having an option, to only log stubbed XHR requests to the command log.

Maybe the best fix would be not a config option, but a toggle on the test runner, that can hide these logs. 

### Test code to reproduce

Test any app that does network requests.

### Versions

617142102,"Click function does not respect coordinates (x, y) if they are 0","<!-- Is this a question? Questions WILL BE CLOSED. Ask in our chat https://on.cypress.io/chat  -->

### Current behavior:

`cy.click` will not respect either coordinate option if it is passed as 0. This is because a truthy comparison is used to set the default option, when it should really check if it is a finite number.

This issue is most likely present on right click and double click as well.

`x` and `y` parameters can be 0 and the function will behave as it does for all other number values (and click the top left of the element).

616472628,Re-query elements that are found 'detached' from the DOM,"### Current behavior:

Currently when Cypress queries an element that was passed from a parent element (say in `.get()`, `.click()` or `.find()`), if the element at some point becomes detached from the DOM, we throw an error:

```
CypressError: cy.click() failed because this element is detached from the DOM.

<element>

Cypress requires elements be attached in the DOM to interact with them.

The previous command that ran was:

  cy.get()

This DOM element likely became detached somewhere between the previous and current command.

Common situations why this happens:
  - Your JS framework re-rendered asynchronously
  - Your app code reacted to an event firing and removed the element

You typically need to re-query for the element or add 'guards' which delay Cypress from running new commands.

### Desired behavior:

Really users just want to re-query the DOM for the previously found element and click on the new element. Because it's more often than not that the framework underneath has created a completely new DOM element and inserted it into the DOM. 

The proposal is to re-query the previously found element and continue the command with any newfound elements. Perhaps this could be an option passed to the command to allow this or not. 

### Reproducible Example

Provided in https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9032

`index.html`

```html
<form>
    <select onchange=""document.forms[0].submit()"">
        <option value=""1"">First</option>
    </select>
    <input />
</form>
```

`spec.js`

```js
it('this will fail but should not', () => {
    cy.visit('index.html')
    cy.get(""select"").select(""First"")
    // adding any wait time will make it pass
    // cy.wait(0)
    cy.get(""input"").type(""Hallo"")
})
```

616340171,stub request with wildcard on dynamic url params?,"Was trying to stub my network request but I still can see the actual api been called in cypress. I did this cypress what went wrong?

```js
describe(""Test"", () => {
    it(""componentDidMount call"", () => {
      cy.fixture(""priceCheck"").as(""priceCheckData"");
      cy.server();
      cy.route(
        ""GET"",
        ""https://staging.gobear.co/price?rate_id=*&gobear_item_id=123"",
        ""@priceCheckData""
      );
    });
  });
```

I think something  iswrong with the wildcard in the route url above, because it worked when I tried an exact match url like this
```js
 cy.route(
      ""GET"",
      "" http://www.mocky.io/v2/5eba1e742f000066953c3520"",
      ""@priceCheckData""
    );
```
So any clue how can I match my url with params? it can be dynamic params like 
```
https://staging.gobear.co/price?rate_id=*
https://staging.gobear.co/price?some_other_id=*
```
hence I can't simply use 
```
https://staging.gobear.co/price*
```

616096223,"Remove regex-based JS/HTML rewriting, switch to AST-based rewriting","AST-based JS/HTML rewriting is available as an experimental feature with https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/5273

Here are the remaining tasks before it can fully replace the existing regex-based rewriting:

- [ ] Validation with users - is it solving the issues we set out to fix?
- [ ] (2) Rewrite all traffic (currently, only AUT's current origin is intercepted)
	- may require inlining `resolvers.ts`
- [ ] (3) Do https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7268 or have it be fixed by inlining `resolvers.ts`
	- or else rewriting will break if a user visits an http:// url that redirects to https://
- [ ] (4) Inject HTML via `parse5` instead of regex.
- [ ] (4) Resolve issue where proxy will no longer work for normal web browsing outside of Cypress frame. Possible solution: inject a stub `window.Cypress.resolveWindowReference` into every html page here: https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/2ed56949cb14b4630ca11ec8c4cda715aa9bfa26/packages/server/lib/util/inject.js#L1-L28
- [ ] (4) Performance measurements:
    - [ ] difference between rewriting with sourcemap and without
	- [ ] comparison to regex-based rewriting
- [ ] (4) Performance improvements: 
	- [ ] improve speed: add streaming parsing/rewriting of JS (parse5 handles rewriting HTML as a stream)
	- [ ] mem usage: explore caching js in deferred-sourcemap-cache on filesystem
	- [ ] understand how sourcemaps are cached in browser and how we can reduce unnecessary regeneration/not store old sourcemaps in RAM
- [ ] (4) Add comments around injected code to help users understand - potentially include original code in a comment
- [ ] (1) Need a real fix for Electron worker_threads https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/23366
- [ ] (4) Fix all code TODOs from original PR: https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/5273",enhancement

### Desired behavior:

Files can be opened even when using a webpack protocol to serve them.

### Test code to reproduce

This issue is reproducible within the [`code-frame-webpack-link-issue`](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app/tree/code-frame-webpack-link-issue) branch of the `cypress-realworld-app` which uses TS spec files and uses `@cypress/webpack-preprocessor`.

1. Clone `https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app.git`
2. Check out [`code-frame-webpack-link-issue`](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app/tree/code-frame-webpack-link-issue)  branch.
3. `yarn`
4. `yarn start`

613967392,Can't overwrite multiple overloads of contains() command correctly,"<!-- Is this a question? Questions WILL BE CLOSED. Ask in our chat https://on.cypress.io/chat  -->

### Current behavior:
When I tried to overwrite two overloads of `.contains()` function only one of them works, another one seems to have misaligned arguments, thus it doesn't work properly.

Contains can work in two modes:
```js
cy.get('.foo').contains('bar', options)
```
and
```js
cy.contains('.foo', 'bar', options)
```

When I defined overwrite for one mode then everything worked fine, however, with override defined for both modes, only the second one is overridden.

<!-- A description including screenshots, stack traces, DEBUG logs, etc -->

### Desired behavior:

<!-- A clear description of what you want to happen -->

### Test code to reproduce

1. Create two overrides:
```js
// overwrites cy.get('.foo').contains('bar', options)
Cypress.Commands.overwrite('contains', (originalFn, subject, chars, options) => {
  return cy.log(options).then(() => originalFn(subject, chars, options));
});

// overwrites cy.contains('.foo', 'bar', options)
Cypress.Commands.overwrite('contains', (originalFn, subject, selector, chars, options) => {
  return cy.log(options).then(() => originalFn(subject, selector, chars, options));
});
```
2. Try to use both overrides in the test:
```js
cy.get('.foo').contains('bar', { some: 'option' });
cy.contains('bar', { some: 'option' });
```
3. Check Cypress log whether `{ some: 'option' }` has been logged for both usages

For such setup, only second .contains() usage will have options correctly logged, however, if we comment out second overwrite then the first one works correctly.

What I'm trying to achieve is to add support for one new option, `strict` (or `fullMatch`), which uses RegExp instead of partial match:

```js
Cypress.Commands.overwrite('contains', (originalFn, subject, chars, options) => {
  if (options && options.strict) {
    chars = new RegExp(`^${chars}$`);
  }

  return originalFn(subject, chars, options);
});
```

613364987,using styled-components or custom component with cypress,"Cypress selector is easy, just do `cy.get('.myComp')` and `<input className=""myComp"" />` will be selected but with styled-component

maybe we need to use custom attribute like cy-data, cy-testid etc. I guess there's no other shortcut than flood our component with those custom attribute right?

The other hassle using cypress is when you use css module, where the class is generated differently every build, and imagine your component is , then you need to pass your the custom attribute all the way down

<Custom cy-data=""btn1"" />

const Custom = ({cy-data}) => <button cy-data={cy-data} />

612123436,Configuring different URL's with the same base domain URL via the cypress.json file,"I am a newbie to Cypress.

I want to create a simple login test to an app which has different tenants and the same base URL.

Ex: Base URL **https://www.xyz.com**

URL's to be tested:

1. **https://www.xyz.com**/**subdomain1**
2. **https://www.xyz.com**/**subdomain2**

Now, I can configure the baseURL property in my cypress.json file to **https://www.xyz.com**

The problem arises when I want to configure the subdomain with the base URL only via the `cypress.json` file. I do not want to hard code the complete URL along with username and password in the spec files.

I want to design my tests in such a way that all URL's and username and passwords are configured via the `cypress.json` file only. All URL's and values should be taken from the cypress.json value without the need for me to hard code them into the spec files.

The following is a list of further work that can be done. It is in no particular order and any given item's inclusion is not a guarantee it will be done. The items need some discussion and prioritization. Once that occurs, items can be broken out into their own issues, so smaller PRs can be made addressing them.

- BUG: Errors that are currently not covered by tests and may not extra work to support source map/code frames:
  - Errors in hooks
  - Returning a promise from a test and rejecting it (cy.js `fail` isn't called)
  - jQuery sizzle errors (invalid selector)
- FEATURE: Add the code frame to the error message/stack, so it appears in stdout and other reporters https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7819
- FEATURE: Show diffs in reporter (#3129 & #4084)
- FEATURE: Code frames and stack translation relies on inline source maps. If we detect there is no source map, show a message about their benefits and points to directions on how to enable them.
- FEATURE: Utilize the stack capturing and source mapping for purposes other than errors
  - Each test in the reporter can have a link that can open the user's IDE to that test's definition
- FEATURE: Should we show the stack trace by default in reporter?
  - It's actually useful and not overly verbose with internal lines
  - Maybe show 3/4 lines, with a 'Show more' button
- FEATURE: Some error messages have multiple error messages. Currently they just display:
  - 'Learn more' links next to each other in the reporter
  - The URLs one after another in stdout
  - We should differentiate them somehow
    - Give them different labels
    - Each may be associated with different parts of the message, so they should be integrated into the message better
    - Maybe the message should have placeholders for them that get replaced differently depending on interactive/non-interactive modes
- PERF: Profile how much time Bluebird spends when we enable longStackTraces (cypress.js) and maybe turn it always off or always on
- FEATURE: Splice out cypress internals when there's a user error (particularly Scenario 2, when error is in a command callback)
  - Alternatively, display them different in the reporter (e.g. less opacity, collapsed with option to open)

- BUG: Chai assertion error messages use quotes instead of backticks
  - ""expected 'actual' to equal 'expected'"" should be ""expected `actual` to equal `expected`""
- FEATURE: Send new error properties to the dashboard
  - Currently we only send the message and stack
  - Send the code frame, parsed stack, and any other useful properties
  - Include information about the command, type of assertion error, etc 
  - Enable opening in IDE from the dashboard
  - Jeff is working on a proposal for what the dashboard would find useful
- FEATURE: Capture and display info like current URL with an error (See [this comment](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3762#issuecomment-499962295))
- FEATURE: Explore opening stack lines in DevTools
  - Either do it instead of opening in IDE (maybe only in certain circumstances) or as an extra option
- FEATURE: Improve how errors are logged (use `console.group`)
- FEATURE: For File Opener Preference modal:
  - Add a learn more link (same as settings for it has in Desktop GUI)
  - 'Settings tab' should be clickable link to go to ‘Settings’ in the Desktop GUI
- FEATURE: Utilize source maps in user's app code
  - This is a technical challenge because we can't access the user's code as easily as the spec code
  - Would need to pull it out of the user's code or have the user opt in and provide a way for us to access it
  - Once we can, it enables:
    - Showing code frames for errors in app code
    - If visit synchronously fails in app code: 
      - Code frame that points to cy.visit in spec code, as it is now
      - A 2nd code frame that points to the app code
      - This might apply to other commands as well, where the error ocurred in the user's app, but we can still associate it with a command (click, etc)
- BUG: When printing error to console, the stack lines show fully qualified URLs instead of source mapped URLs
- BUG: When importing/requiring a file outside the project root, the path is not correct (`../foo` flattens into `webpack:///foo`)
- ~Make individual lines in the code frame clickable (then open in IDE)~

608940439,Number inputs that are manually focused do not respect the caret position during `cy.type()`,"### Current behavior:

I've set up a small repro app (link below) that has a button. When clicking on this button, an `<input type=""number"" value=""1"" />` is created and manually focused (by calling `focus()` on it).

In my test, I click on this button, wait for the input to show up, and then attempt to type something into this input. Instead of appending typed characters to the end of the input (where the cursor is), Cypress appends them to the beginning of the input.

### Desired behavior:

I expect the the typed character to be appended to the end of the input (where the cursor is), and the written test to pass.

### Current behavior:

<!-- A description including screenshots, stack traces, DEBUG logs, etc -->
When running tests with Firefox in CI (GitHub Actions), it randomly fails to start with this error:
```
Cypress could not connect to Firefox.

An unexpected error was received from Marionette connection:

Error: cannot open socket

To avoid this error, ensure that there are no other instances of Firefox launched by Cypress running.
```

It may be linked to #6504 , but because the environment seems to be different, I think a new issue is more appropriate.

607412878,Changing currentTime of HTMLVideoElement in Cypress always sets to 0 (Chrome/Electron),"### Current behavior:

In the application I am currently working on, we allow users to change the current time of a video according to a keyframe, which they can click on. Each keyframe has a corresponding timestamp, which then with a click event will set the video elements `currentTime` to this timestamp (in seconds)

I can confirm that this feature works in Firefox/Chrome browsers. 

We are using Cypress to ensure that when clicking on a keyframe, the video players `currentTime` is set correctly in the UI. 

However when trying to change the `currentTime` inside of Chrome/Electron within the Cypress environment the `currentTime` is always set to `0`. There doesn't appear to be any issues when running Cypress with Firefox. 

### Desired behavior:

When setting the `currentTime` property of a `HTMLVideoElement`. It should be set correctly, and not always to `0`. 

### Test code to reproduce

Unfortunately due to the project not being open-source, I cannot post screenshots, or code directly from the project. 

- The test should be reproducible by loading any MP4 into a html video element (I tried with a variety of different test videos found [here](https://gist.github.com/jsturgis/3b19447b304616f18657)
- Setting the `currentTime` with an on `click` event, should always set `currentTime = 0` even though the value > 0. 

Here is a Typescript code snippet of the function we're calling: 

```ts
const setTime = ({ player, begin }: { player: HTMLVideoElement, begin: number }) => {
    if (player && begin != null) {
      player.currentTime = begin;
    }
  }

### Description
I cannot find a way to resolve data in `cy.request().then()`, using a `Cypress.Promise`:

### Code
```javascript
 it('get inst state', () => {
    getInstState().then(res => {

      resolve(res);
    });
  });
}
```

### result

I return a `Cypress.Promise` instance in `.then() `, but  this code always logs `res:  null`

I want to chaining `cy.request()` like this: 

```javascript
 it('get inst state', () => {
    getInstState().then(res => {
      console.log('res: ', res);
      instAction(res).then(actionResult => {

        // next request;
      })
    });

function getInstState() {
  return cy.request({

    headers,
  }).then(res => {
    expect(res.status).equal(200);
   // do something
    return new Cypress.Promise(resolve => {
      resolve(res);
    });
  });
}

function instAction(res) {
  expect(res.status).equal(200);
  const items = res.body.items;
  return cy.request({

Hi, daily cypress user here again. I noticed this behavior.

### Current behavior:

I started stubbing my server requests to make stuff faster. The following way:

```js
function stubRequest(){
    cy.server();
    cy.route({
        method: 'PUT',
        url: '/api/users/Fvgq5e8jzl8.json',
        response: 'fixture:editUser.response.json'
    }).as('saveUser');
}

function inspectRequest(){
    cy.wait('@saveUser').its('request.body').should('deep.equal', editUserRequest);
}
```

Basically my REACT app edits a user and then I click save and send the result back to the server.

However, cypress interjects and inspects the outgoing request:
`.its('request.body').should('deep.equal', editUserRequest);`

Well I noticed that cypress is `waiting`:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47790868/80108674-8a255d00-854a-11ea-8322-3b3be4245877.png)


### Desired behavior:

<!-- A clear description of what you want to happen -->

Why Is cypress waiting?

The desired request is known. The fired request is known.
They won't change. No need to wait.
It would make my tests faster if cypress would remove wait times by default in this context.
I can do it manually.

It can be very useful for testing correct behavior around responsive images.

### Desired behavior:

Have the possibility to switch the DevicePixelRatio in cypress.

Viewport dimension changes and testing the `currentSrc` is already very useful. 
Having DevicePixelRatio in cypress would enable finer tests.

Not applicable as it's not implemented.

- look at the list of returned client rectangles, not just at the first one. A simple check would be to skip the rectangles with `width:0` or `height:0`. A more robust check would be to get the coordinates and then check which element at those coordinates would receive the event. In our case, it would be parent `div`, because the first element has zero dimension.

599117103,Not able to switch to new browser tab and continue testing or directly invoking that new tab,"I have a scenario where on a page, it opens a new tab on clicking a span element and wanted to continue testing on that new window. The url on the new window is an encrypted dynamic one. 

I had seen resource pages regarding this, but the examples are generic ones. I am still not sure how to do cy.request as mentioned in one of the solution with my case where clicking on button opens the new tab and the call happens which is rerouted through a diff system too and the url is an encoded one like ...12e6361746e6d732e636f6d$$/auth/logon?goToUrl=https%3A%2.... Not sure how can i directly do cy.request for this. Or stub this. Can you give me a specific example for doing this. Also i am not testing it on localHost, but from Jenkins.

Steps:
Login on the main screen -> while clicking on the span element button, it opens new browser tab[No call or href tag on the span element on the main screen] -> The new tab opened to login again has the above kind of call... -> Need to switch to this new tab or need to skip the first login and continue login from there and test the scenarios.

598346515,Feature Request: WebAuthn/FIDO2 testing via virtual authenticators,"### Current behavior:

Cypress does not support any way to test WebAuthn / FIDO2 flows without mocking the authenticator, which does not allow to test all cryptographic interactions sufficiently. If a valid request is forwarded to the browser, it will be delegated out of the browser and can not be interacted with.

### Desired behavior:

Just like [Selenium implemented it end of last year](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/pull/7760), Cypress should offer a way to use the [W3C automation API](https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#sctn-automation) to programatically interact with the browser to manage virtual authenticators that can confirm actions without leaving the browser context.

598047513,Feature request: .stop() command,"Something similar to .pause() but instead of pausing the run, just make the test stop altogether. Might be useful if you need to run only part of test. Now you do it by commenting out the rest of the test.

Example:

```javascript
it('Should test a thing', () => {

  // gets executed
  cy
    .get('item')

  // similarly to .pause() is ignored in CLI

.pause() is good and all, but I cannot stop the test after it is paused, just continue or go to next step. .debug() turns on debugger, which is not the thing I necessarily need.

596766621,Performance issues of the Runner when using Cypress commands on many DOM elements at once,"### Current behavior:
As QA, I want to be able to quickly validate that all images on the target page have links ('http' string inside the target attribute) to the source files.

By using the code below that includes .each() command to be able to iterate an array of ~90 links, the Cypress runner **hangs**, i.e. becomes frozen for about 20 seconds.

The time that Cypress takes to validate the assertion is in direct proportion to the number of elements in the array. E.g. if I click the _Show more_ button to fetch a new portion of VODs, Cypress will double the time.

**The block of target HTML**
Please note that mobile, tablet, desktop breakpoints have different source images per item, i.e. if there are **30** images on the page, there will be **90** checks in Cypress

591081450,Can't pass hash values containing exponential operators to --env command line option.,"### Current behavior:
We use `--env` variable to pass some environment variables to cypress, when it's running both in headless and headed mode. 

One of the parameters is a hash (mix of numbers and characters). Surprisingly some specific hash values make cypress to fail reading this value from the command line (e.g. `769e98018`). The corresponding environment variable is not set and the `Cypress.env()` function returns with `null`.

### Desired behavior:
It should not be a problem to read a hash from the command line and put into an environment variable.

### Test code to reproduce
A simplified command line call:

```
node_modules/cypress/bin/cypress open --env WSD_VERSION_HASH=769e98018
```

Test code showing the issue:

```js
describe('Hash test.', function() {
    it('Test 1.', function() {
        expect(Cypress.env('WSD_VERSION_HASH')).to.equal('769e98018');
    });
});
```

This test fails with: 'expected null to equal 769e98018'

If I remove the 'e' character for example, then the value is read correctly.

Test repo https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-native-chrome-code-coverage-example/tree/add-hang

In this repo branch `add-hang` when launching the Chrome browser the plugin grabs the RDP socket and then connects too.

I edited the Cypress `browsers/cri-client.ts` file and added a 10 second delay before it tries to connect. Thus we get the following situation

- Cypress launches Chrome browser
- my plugin connects to RDP socket and executes (maliciously) `cdp.Page.navigate({ url: 'chrome://hang' })` causing the Chrome tab to hang
- after 10 seconds, Cypress tries to connect, and then sends page navigate event.
- everything just hangs forever

When running with debug logs, I see we send the navigate command, but without timeout it never receives a response from hanging tab

Typing into several inputs in a single test where there are XHR requests that goes out during each keypress event - like `keyup` or similar - causes the tests to slow down over time.

The network request responses do not seem to be responding any slower over time. 

This slowness does *not* occur if you split up the typing across several tests.

583170691,cy.request unable to handle `Same-Site: None` cookie for cross origin requests,"<!-- Is this a question? Questions WILL BE CLOSED. Ask in our chat https://on.cypress.io/chat  -->

### Facts:
1. `cy.request` should persist cookies received in response headers. It does it just fine except this used case described below.
2. Google just published a new update to chrome browsers which breaks cookie persistance for cross origin requests
3. This is a new issue which just occurred after receiving a chrome update this weekend. This only affects my cypress environment. When testing manually on same version of chrome it's just fine.

1. I send a `cy.request` to login to our server before running tests:

2. This was just fine and it would set a cookie for chrome browser.

3. Then I can run my tests against a local instance of my app at `http://localhost:3003` while the app requests cross-origin resources from `dev.xxxx.org`. The server `dev.xxxx.org` knows I am logged in because with each request my Chrome provides session id cookie.

### Behavior after chrome update (current behavior)

1. I do my login via `cy.request` as in the case above. But cypress fails to persist the cookie due to the following Chrome security complains:

```
A cookie associated with a cross-site resource at https://dev.xxxx.org/ was set without the 'SameSite' attribute. It has been blocked, as Chrome now only delivers cookies with cross-site requests if they are set with SameSite=None and Secure. You can review cookies in developer tools under Application>Storage>Cookies and see more details at https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5088147346030592 and https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5633521622188032.
```

Long story short: Chrome is complaining it can't store my session id cookie because it's missing `SameSite=None and Secure` attributes.

The problem is that the attributes are NOT missing. Look at raw output here:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47790868/76882070-7eaa8c00-6850-11ea-91c5-f97e8b33b00f.png)

### Conclusions

I believe that cypress swallows the `Same-Site` attribute while persisting cookies from `cy.request`

A hint is is also that `cy.setCookie` is completely missing `Same-Site` parameter:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47790868/76882192-ae599400-6850-11ea-9ff2-810e0bbfca46.png)

### Temporary solution

1. Downgrade Chrome 80.0.3987.132

### Current behavior:
Hi, 
Currently, when testing out the visibility of `.spinner` for [nprogress](https://ricostacruz.com/nprogress/), it shows as being not visible due to the position being fixed although the spinning circle loader is certainly visible on the page. I'm aware of the complexity of the current algorithm used to determine visibility so I thought this might help give a simple, reproducible example of where this may (if I'm understanding correctly) fail. It says that it's being covered by the html wrapper itself, but the element has a z-index set to 1031.

<!-- A description including screenshots, stack traces, DEBUG logs, etc -->

### Desired behavior:
It should be considered visible as it's not being covered by any element in the DOM.

<!-- A clear description of what you want to happen -->

### Test code to reproduce
https://github.com/josh-byster/cypress-visibility

There is a `visibility.spec.js` which has a basic assertion of visibility in there that should show the issue.
If there's any trouble with reproducibility, it can probably be tested directly at the [nprogress website](https://ricostacruz.com/nprogress/) to check if the spinner is visible.

576240377,`requestTimeout` and `responseTimeout` should apply individually to each request in `cy.wait([])` with array of requests,"### Current behavior:

`cy.wait()` [can be passed an array of aliases](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/wait.html#Arguments). This is good. However, it is not clear what the impact on the [timeout](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/wait.html#Timeouts) is. `cy.wait()` has 2 timeouts, `requestTimeout` and `responseTimeout`.

I guess that if before `requestTimeout` all aliases have matched, then `cy.wait()` will be happy. But what if only a few of the aliases have matched while others have not matched yet?

From my experiment, passing several aliases to `cy.wait()` means:

> ""I want all requests to be sent before `requestTimeout`""
 
### Desired behavior:

The current behavior makes sense but I was expecting a completely different semantics:

> ""I don't want to wait more than `requestTimeout` between a response is received and the next request is sent"".

I think the documentation should be improved about that so I opened [an issue on the cypress-documentation project](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-documentation/issues/2573).

Still, @jennifer-shehane believes that the semantics of `cy.wait()` could benefit from being changed to match what we both expect.

But I can't see other APIs (`/kappnav/namespaces`) being hit and the `cy.wait()` getting timedout as its not getting hit.

573694957,cypress should live reload when changes made to `fixturesFolder`,"### Current behavior:

When changing `plugins` or `fixtures`, the tests opened by `cypress open` are not auto-reloaded as they are when changes are made to `cypress/integration` or `cypress/support` files.

### Desired behavior:

Unless there is some good reason for it, I would expect the pages would reload. While I can see that `plugins` might be more consequential in having unintended side-effects, so too can `support` files (which can use plugins by way of commands), I would at least think that changes to`fixtures` would trigger reloads, and I'd personally like to see changes to `plugins` be able to do so.

### Test code to reproduce

1. Run `cypress open` on some repository.
2. Open a test file
3. Modify a file in `/plugins`
4. See that the test file does not reload (nor does the command line show changes)

### Current behavior:

It's possible for certain errors to be uncaught in the plugins process. If the error occurs soon after we create the plugins process and is asynchronous, it will not be caught. Such an error should cause the main Cypress process to fail, but it does not.

### Desired behavior:

Any errors thrown in the plugins process should fail the main Cypress process.

### Test code to reproduce

Add this to the plugins file and run a simple test:

```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
  throw new Error('Root async error from plugins file')
})

module.exports = () => {}
```

Since it's a race condition, the issue might not always occur and the error will be properly displayed. But it will reproduce the issue if run a few times.

As a developer I write a lot of tests. An error like `CypressError: Timed out retrying: Expected to find element: '.product-widget', but never found it.` may not really tell me why the test failed. especially if it is a way more complex test than above.

Can y'all please verify that Firefox runs on my machine before the next release 😅 I can't debug other people's issues without being able to run Firefox.

### Test code to reproduce

`cypress open` or `cypress run` on MacOS Mojave 10.14.6

Debug logs at time of choosing Firefox browser

561314392,MacOS not detecting Microsoft Edge as a launch-able browser,"### Current behavior:

Running cypress open fails to detect edge as selectable browser in the dropdown.  Have tried using cypress run --browser edge (which tells me it can't detect an edge browser) as well as providing an absolute path of 

cypress run --browser /Applications/Microsoft\ Edge.app/Contents/MacOS/Microsoft\ Edge

That seems to run electron in the terminal instead of edge though this could just be because cypress hasn't been setup to run edge headlessly.  I double checked that I had edge installed and the binary was in the place I expected it to be.

This file https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/develop/packages/launcher/lib/darwin/index.ts

indicates where cypress is looking so I am a bit stumped.

(Just noticed that the const detectEdge doesn't provide ""Microsoft Edge.app"" line like say the const detectFirefox does on line 27 of the link I provided above.  Might that be the issue?

### Desired behavior:

Edge binary should be automatically detected by cypress.

560732205,Recorded videos from Firefox play at the wrong speed,"<!-- Is this a question? Questions WILL BE CLOSED. Ask in our chat https://on.cypress.io/chat  -->

### Current behavior:
* Firefox records videos as a WEBM with variable framerate.
* When Cypress streams these chunks to `ffmpeg`, the variable framerate is incorrectly interpreted at a constant 15fps.
* This results in the output video appearing to run more quickly and more slowly at times, as the CPU load of other processes go up and down and affect the output framerate.
* A related issue occurs when a navigation of the `runner` occurs, which causes the timestamps of the WEBM to reset to 0.

### Desired behavior:
* Use the correct `ffmpeg` options so that the timestamp and framerates are accurately represented in the final captured `mp4`.
	* https://github.com/stoyanovgeorge/ffmpeg/wiki/Variable-Frame-Rate recommended `.outputOption('-vsync=0').videoFilter('setpts=N/FRAME_RATE/TB')`
	* `framerate` video filter may help: https://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-all.html#framerate

Long story short; I use Cypress at work and performance is scarce (probably since we are using VDIs), but the tests will run around four times faster when I collapse all subsections in the Command Log.

During headless runs it's not even possible to interact with the Command Log, so a test suite with ten files that usually takes around 30 minutes will instead take a few hours.

I want a new option in cypress.json (something like `keepCommandLogSectionsClosed` but a bit shorter...) that, when set to true, keeps the Command Log subsections collapsed by default during test runs.

> The sweet spot of Cypress is to be used as a tool to test your own application as you build it. It is built for developers and QA engineers, not manual testers or exploratory testing.

You already know that is what the browser is designed to do and you already know that it is triggered by the target=""_blank"" attribute.

I beg to differ.

This is a classic case of integration test in specific kind of applications - payment applications, where a large number of payment providers (i.e Adyen) require a flow for 3DS1 to open a new window via POST, enter fields, and return to the rest of the flow. 

As I see it, cypress helps in checking integration tests of these kind, where control of the browser is handled by cypress via code. Switching tabs, opening and closing them, having several windows communicate via web socket or similar and testing how they work is essential for a complete suite of browser testing.

551363985,"Inline, zero-dimension element: erroneous visibility determination","# Current behavior:
[This](https://github.com/badeball/cypress-reproducible-issues/tree/master/zero-dimension-hover) example illustrates an element with `offsetWidth` and `offsetHeight` of zero, but is still interactable in actuality.

For reference, Firefox does not report these values to be zero, which might be of interest in regards to expanding browser support (ie. maybe not good to rely on it as it's not consistent across).

### Desired behavior:
For the element not to be reported as invisible.

I don't really know how to investigate this further. It happens every time I try to click this selector playground button (boxed in red). So it has never worked for me on the sites I need to test.

### Desired behavior:

I would like the playground selector to work as described by its documentation. It very obviously is not working on these sites. I'll understand if this is an issue that cypress can't fix if it is only specific to certain sites. Maybe it really is an issue contained primarily in cypress code though? Or maybe I can find help on how I can resolve it on my end.

### Steps to reproduce: (app code and test code)

simply run a test that only visits this URL:

1. `cy.visit('https://help.doterra.com/')`
2. Open the playground selector
3. Click on the arrow button as if to select elements (the one boxed in red from the first screen shot)
4. mouse off of that button and immediately I always see the mobx console error, if it hasn't occurred even earlier
5. At this point the selector playground seems stuck and the error will happen over and over trying to click that button

If I need to create a more contained environment to reproduce it in, I can do that, but I figured this should work since that is a public site. It would be very interesting to me if someone else could not reproduce it this way.

539824537, cy.wait() timeout even though XHR requests were made (graphql requests),"<!-- Is this a question? Don't open an issue. Ask in our chat https://on.cypress.io/chat  -->

### Current behavior:
We have a project using [Relay](https://relay.dev/en/) which uses a single GraphQL API endpoint. Due to route nesting, most pages in this project call the GraphQL endpoint several times (anywhere from 2 to 6 calls) causing a waterfall of API calls.

To test if a page has loaded correctly we define a `beforeEach` block that starts `cy.server()` and defines the route `cy.route('POST', '/graphql').as('graphql')`. Then in the `it(...)` block we `cy.visit('/')` the page and then call `cy.wait('@graphql')` as many times as the endpoint gets hit.

Now requests to the endpoint always happen in the same order but responses do not (which is to be expected). When responses come back `cy.wait()` will sometimes get confused and timeout.

For example. Let's say the page does 3 requests and so we wait 3 times. The first request comes back and the first wait will pick it up. Now the test is waiting for the second request to resolve but the third request comes back instead before the second one. The second wait will then pick up the third response and the test continues to the third wait. Then the second response comes back but the third wait will not pick it up and times out saying that a response never occurred.

It might be that the second request resolved last but before the third `cy.wait()` call.

I hope this is not too confusing :)

Here's a screenshot of what I just explained. Note the response order in the console and that they all resolved correctly but `cy.wait()` timed out anyways.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6989161/71107133-8e053500-218e-11ea-91af-50723512674f.png)

Here is the same test passing.

The more `cy.wait()`s the higher the failure rate of the test. if you're only waiting for two requests it rarely fails.

We get the same behavior if we call `cy.wait(['@graphql', '@graphql', '@graphql'])`

Here's the example test code. I'll be linking the repo below
```javascript
/// <reference types=""Cypress"" />

const getQueryName = function(xhr) {
  const regexp = /\w+Query/gm;
  const match = xhr.requestBody.query.match(regexp);
  return match[0];
};

context(""Wait issue"", () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    cy.server();
    cy.route({
      method: ""POST"",
      url: ""**/next-js-with-relay-modern-example"",
      // optional route config added only for debugging
      onRequest: xhr => console.log(""onRequest:"", getQueryName(xhr)),
      onResponse: xhr => console.log(""onResponse:"", getQueryName(xhr)),
      onAbort: args => console.log(""onAbort:"", args)
    }).as(""query"");
  });

  it(""does not timeout 01"", () => {
    // first we vist url which triggers
    // waterfall calls to graphql endpoint
    cy.visit(""/"");

    // now we wait for requests to resolve
    // NOTE: .then(...) added only for debugging
    cy.wait(""@query"").then(xhr => cy.log(""query1:"", getQueryName(xhr)));
    cy.wait(""@query"").then(xhr => cy.log(""query2:"", getQueryName(xhr)));
    cy.wait(""@query"").then(xhr => cy.log(""query3:"", getQueryName(xhr)));
    cy.wait(""@query"").then(xhr => cy.log(""query4:"", getQueryName(xhr)));
    cy.wait(""@query"").then(xhr => cy.log(""query5:"", getQueryName(xhr)));
  });
});
```

### Desired behavior:

`cy.wait()` picks up all responses correctly and does not timeout

### Steps to reproduce: (app code and test code)

I have created an [example project repo](https://github.com/daironmichel/cypress-wait-timeout-example) that you can clone and run locally

```bash
git clone git@github.com:daironmichel/cypress-wait-timeout-example.git
cd cypress-wait-timeout-example
yarn install
yarn dev
```
run test on cypress
```bash
yarn run cypress open
```
Run `wait.spec.js`

Note: You might need to run it 2 or 3 times to see it fail.

**Why is it a problem?**

Cypress floods the CI output with not needed information. Other tools like Jest + Puppeteer, Behat, PHPUnit are providing just dots output for the test result and it is very useful for CI.
And it looks like that in CI output
```
...........................................
```
And I see the full output only in case of error.

### Desired behavior:

I have an option in the config to not only choose a custom or mocha reporter but also to switch off the default output.

```
reporterDefaultOutput: false
```

In this case, the only reporter specified in `reporter` config option outputs to console. I should see only dots in the case of `dot` reporter specified in the config and the default output is switched off.

### Steps to reproduce: (app code and test code)

Set
`""reporter"": ""dot""`
or
`""reporter"": ""nyan""`

in cypress.json. do `cypress run`, see the mixed output.

537599902,Filter non-default orgs before checking to display empty orgs view during project setup,"### Current behavior:

Our services are moving away from always utilizing a 'default organization'. The Desktop-Gui however is naively expecting a 'default organization' to always be present. 

The user facing consequence of this is that if an organization has 1 organization that is not a default organization - ~maybe they converted it to professional~ (this actually can't happen because we create a new default org) or only have 1 organization setup due to SSO login - then the organization selection will display as empty and they cannot select an organization to set up their project within.

536596786,Authentication events for plugins,"### Current behavior:

Plugins cannot interact with the http traffic through the plugin API. The only way to build a authentication plugin today is by using an external proxy process.

### Desired behavior:

A plugin API for authentication. 
#### auth-request event
In essence there would need to be an ""auth-request"" event in the plugin API, which is triggered when Cypress receives a 401 response with a `www-authenticate` header. The API call should pass at least the following arguments:
* content of the `www-authenticate` header (or headers) 
* client endpoint (at least port)
* server endpoint (hostname, protocol, port, path)

The auth plugin should then return the content for an `authorization` header to be used in the next request to the server. Cypress should then resend the previous request with this new header set. If the auth cycle is complete (non 401 response), all is well. If not, another call to the auth plugin may be required. (Some protocols require just one rountrip while others require two roundtrips).
The auth plugin could also return null if it does not support the required authentication protocol. 

#### auth-free event
To allow the plugin to clean up authorization states, there should be an additional ""auth-free"" event, which should be called when the client socket is destroyed. 

#### Auth method registration
A possible addition could be that the plugin should register which authentication methods it supports during initialization. This would simplify a scenario where multiple auth plugins are used simultaneously to cover different methods.

#### Benefits
As the developer of the NTLM authentication plugin [cypress-ntlm-auth](https://github.com/bjowes/cypress-ntlm-auth) I see many benefits with the suggested auth plugin API.
* No external proxy would be required to deal with authentication
  - greatly reducing the complexity for developers to develop authentication plugins
  - better performance
* Cypress is aware that authentication is performed
* An auth plugin could be used also for proxy authentication

#### Help needed?
If this suggestion makes sense to you, I would be happy to assist in making it happen.

For example library https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-react-unit-test is not allowing to tests portals approach,  impossible to test CSS-in-js, and anything that needs access to the document object, approach. 

### Reason
The main problem: when we want to render the application from the tests (like we have `cy.mount`) we understand that our tests are running from the different iframe. And this is the main problem for the component-based tests approach. 

### Request for change:
I propose to add a new config field like `mountMode: true` and just load an application right to the `.aut-frame`. This will fix all the problems 
> P.S. Already have a working code example will make a PR right in a few mins
> P.P.S I believe that cypress tests for components can take over the world. Because this is much more reliable than jest, enzyme, testing-library or anything. Moreover, it is super interactive so it is possible to use it as a kind of replacement for storybook.

535021781,Allow configuration of `capture` option for screenshots taken during failure,"### Current behavior:
When my test fails, the screenshot taken is always captured in the `runner` size as per the documentation: https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/screenshot-api.html#Arguments:
>  For screenshots automatically taken on test failure, capture is always coerced to runner.

 I was curious, why that's the case? I think it'd be beneficial to be able to override this configuration even for the screenshot on failure:
```js
Cypress.Screenshot.defaults({
  capture: 'fullPage'
})
```
Often times I find myself looking at a failure video where Cypress can't find an element and I'm only seeing a portion of the page which isn't really helpful.

### Desired behavior:
When I configure Cypress to capture screenshots like so:
```js
Cypress.Screenshot.defaults({
  capture: 'fullPage'
})
```

I expect Cypress to take screenshot of the Full Page on failure rather than always taking `runner` despite the configuration.

533797396,Take screenshots using Chrome DevTools Protocol ,"### Current behavior:

Cypress screenshot algorithm is complicated and has introduced several challenges.

- Cypress doesn't take correct snapshots in 'fullPage' mode in Electron and Chrome browsers https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5876
- Screenshot of webGL content does not render anything https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5792

2. The blackout area is not accurately calcuated at different viewport sizes (Chrome 78).

#### 1. Chrome versions < 78

Below, the screenshot should black out the red area, but as you can see in Chrome 77 it is not.

I'd like to test login page on Ionic (v3) website. But when I invoke method `.type` there appears error:

```
CypressError: cy.type() failed because it targeted a disabled element.
```

Error does not occurs always. Test fails is about 20-25% runs. Analysing Cypress' source code I realized that it can behave that way because Input is not focused. I was looking at file: https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/70ef58bede981567732697c8b79fe7642ab164cf/packages/driver/src/cy/commands/actions/type.js from 407 line. 

So I added method `.focus` before `.type`. But then I am given another error: 

```
CypressError: Timed out retrying: expected '<input.text-input.text-input-md>' to have value 'asdasddd', but the value was 'adasddd'
```

which means that not every character was typed into input (propably every, but not second)

### Desired behavior:

I assume that I have done everything right, and there is no problem with my website, so expected result would be not to got any error using method `.type`. Otherwise, please tell if I'm doing anything incorrect

525900273,Cypress does not bypass a domain properly ,"Hi!
I work in an organization that uses PAC. From the cypress specifications I have to use:

_If your organization uses a PAC file, contact a network administrator to ask what HTTP proxy you should be using to access the general Internet, then use that proxy with Cypress._

However, I can't use a proxy for my project, because ""internal"" calls should be called just without a proxy. The portal works only in the intranet and without proxy. 

This is the response from the support team (from my organization):

_Please clarify with cypress team, if no PAC can be used, then tool must be adjusted so that no proxy is used because ""internal"" calls should be called just without a proxy._

So I used NO_PROXY, like in the Cypress documentation says and the domain from my project is bypassed (at least it says in Cypress Settings)

`""test:no_proxy1"": ""set NO_PROXY=int....at.inside && npm run test:open"",`

### Desired behavior:

`cy.visit('about:blank')` navigates to `about:blank`

### Background

In our application we register some listener on storage events. During before each cypress cleans the storage. This results into failing in our application, because our application is still running from the previous test case.
It should be possible to leave our application for example in after each by visiting `about:blank`.

I think the easiest way would be adding another option parameter to the visit command to skip adding base url to the target url:

```

In the Cypress commands.js file I have:
```js
Cypress.onVueError = function(err) {
    assert.isNotOk(err, err.message);
}
```

Now the trick is how can I fail the currently running test from `Cypress.onVueError` without trying to access the DOM to force a failure? 

Why is there no `cy.fail(""reason"")` method in Cypress for special cases like this? I could not find anything like this in the docs.

It seems like Cypress should handle this on it's own or at least have a plugin or something.

### Current behavior:
Currently, in order to load multiple fixtures you have to do something like [this](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-recipes/blob/master/examples/fundamentals__fixtures/cypress/integration/multiple-fixtures-spec.js) or [this](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2932)

<!-- images, stack traces, etc -->

### Desired behavior:
It would be really nice from a user perspective if we could load multiple fixtures like so:
```js
cy.fixture(['file1', 'file2']).then(files => {
    cy.log(files); // [ firstFile, secondFile ]
}
```
Why this would be nice is that it makes the code a lot neater as well you don't have to navigate through callback hell especially if you're trying to load more than two or three fixtures at once. Personally, This would be nice to have for something like file uploads where you potentially want to upload more than one file at a time.

### Current behavior:

When you hover over a step in the ""timetravel"" history (which is a very cool feature, BTW), if you have CSS keyframe animations, they will re-run, which is odd and potentially misleading.

### Desired behavior:

The DOM history should look exactly like it did at that point in time.

### Steps to reproduce: (app code and test code)

I have an error panel that comes down from the top of the screen when it is placed in the DOM. This is accomplished via CSS:

```css
    #error-panel {
      animation: flash-error 200ms ease-in-out;
    }

    @keyframes flash-error {
      0% {
        transform: translateY(-100%);
      }
      100% {
        transform: translateY(0%);
      }
    }
```

When I hover the mouse over a previous step in the Cypress UI, the panel animates down every time.

501794825,How to ensure all react components are loaded before cy.screenshot(),"### Current behavior: 

When trying to get screenshots of pages, even after waiting for all xhr requests and checking elements exist, `cy.screenshot()` will capture the page in an intermediate loading state where some things haven't rendered yet.

I do not want to use `cy.wait(1000)` as it is hacky and has caused my problems further down the test chain, such as random timeouts on screenshots.

### Desired behavior:

Is there any way to check a component has rendered and is visible before taking the screenshot?

### Steps to reproduce: (app code and test code)

Here is an example where it works when I add a wait but not without:
```js
cy.fixture(QA_FIXTURE).as('fixture');
  cy.server();
  cy.route('POST', '/v1.0/blobs/sign-url/').as('signUrl');

  cy.selectLatestActivity('/activity/');

  cy.get('@fixture').then(fixture => {
    if (fixture.BUILD_PREFIX === 'blah') {
      cy.log(fixture.BUILD_PREFIX);
      cy.wait('@signUrl').then(xhrs => {
        cy.wrap(xhrs.status).should('eq', 200);
      });
    }
  });
  cy.wait(2000);
  cy.screenshot();
  cy.get('[data-cy=""close_btn""]').click();
``` 

the signurl fucntion is the last request to occur, and even if use something like:
```js
cy.get('[data-cy=""close_btn""]').then(() => {cy.screenshot();});
```
To ensure the button is there after the request, it will still be a race to whether the component has rendered and the screenshot saved.

Normally when asserting that an element is not visible (using `.should('not.be.visible')`), if the element does not exist in the DOM, the assertion passes.

For some reason, simply by including the Stripe JS SDK in the head of the document (following the instructions [here](https://stripe.com/docs/web/setup#setup)), the `not.be.visible` assertion fails (by timing out when retrying to find the element) when the element is not in the DOM.

499039004,"Proposal: allow configuration file to be 'js', not 'json'","# Goal

Simplify Cypress configuration

# Why

Why is this important? Why is it a priority?

* Currently, allowing configuration from multiple different places (`cypress.json`, `cypress.env.json`, `pluginsFile`) is confusing and difficult to document well
* Users need to specify different configuration based on environment (https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/909), which doesn't work with `cypress.json`
* It's not possible to use comments in `cypress.json`

Related:
* Unable to use deeply nested configuration (https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1736)

# Implementation

* Get rid of `cypress.json` and `cypress.env.json`
* Move the `pluginsFile` to `<projectRoot>/cypress.js`
* All configuration is from what's returned from `cypress.js`

# Questions

- Can/should we support TypeScript/CoffeeScript/etc (`cypress.ts`, `cypress.coffee`)?
- How do we handle writing the `projectId` when a user sets up their project to record
- Should we change the API of `cypress.js` to be different from the current API of the `pluginsFile`. Since it's the only way to configure Cypress, it might be good to make the use-case of only using it for configuration easier. Instead of:

```js
module.exports = () => {
  return {
    baseUrl: 'http://localhost:1234'
  }
}
```

We could allow them to export an object if they don't need to register events:

```js
module.exports = {
  baseUrl: 'http://localhost:1234'
}
```

# Research

## How other projects deal with TypeScript/CoffeeScript for config files

* Webpack supports it: https://webpack.js.org/configuration/configuration-languages/#typescript
* Jest does not support it (must be `.js` or `.json`)
* Looks like webpack is using this: https://github.com/gulpjs/interpret (Not a huge fan of that much documentation just to support configuration in typescript... but I do understand that users will want this.)

# Notes

- I would go with always requiring a function the same way we do with plugins to avoid needing to do error handling and documentation in two different ways

---

via @brian-mann 

Another change is that we will need to resolve default configuration and overrides **prior** to calling the config function so you can utilize those values.

Before it was...

- cypress.json
- env var overrides
- cli arguments

now it will be...

- env var overrides
- cli arguments
- cypress.js

which means we need to pass the defaults along with the overrides to the function so it can continue to change them.

```js
// something like this
module.exports = (defaults, overrides) => {}
module.exports = (defaultsIncludingOverrides) => {}

// or the jest approach
const { defaultConfigurationOptions } = require('cypress')

module.exports = (overrides) => {}
```

I think we also need to decide what to do with `env` and whether or not this should be set as a property of the default configuration or not.

We either need to keep it separate or merge it with the config.

```js
module.exports = (env, config) => {}
module.exports = (envWithConfig) => {}
```

Right now its confusing because you work with it separately in the driver with `Cypress.env(...)` but it ends up being a property on `config`, but is set through a separate CLI flag: `--env`.

It should be either a separate thing or a part of config.

EDIT: we may not want to change the order of resolving the env + config else this would force the user to **always** merge the overrides in, else they'd be ignored. That would also force the user to have a valid `cypress.js` which we want to make optional.

Disregard what I said above about setting overrides. We could go with the `defaultConfigurationOptions` since that is separate (or perhaps yield that in) but keep resolution to happen downstream.

---

via @brian-mann 

To make matters even more confusing... `CYPRESS_` env vars are special in that they...

1. can override configuration if they match a configuration option
2. are automatically set onto `config.env`

This was done a long time ago because without the ability to execute anything in `node` it was difficult to set environment variables in the traditional way and know that the user wanted them in the driver. It would be a vulnerability to just automatically attach everything on `process.*` onto `Cypress.env()`.

Anyway with the ability to write configuration, setting env vars becomes much easier because you can just do the ones you care about.

```js
module.exports = (something) => {
  return {
    env: {
      ...process.env,
      someValue: process.env.whatever
    }
  }
}
```

If we want to allow overriding configuration we could continue to accept env vars but namespace them like `CYPRESS_CONFIG_BASE_URL=...`

Setting a `CYPRESS_FOO` would no longer mean anything, but we could also still support a `CYPRESS_ENV_FOO=bar` which would set `{ foo: bar }`

I'm still conflicted on whether or not to make `env` a property on `config` or vice versa or keep them separate.

We could namespace them like this...

```js
module.exports = () => {
  return {
    config: {...},
    env: {...}
  }
}
```

Which would make more sense per how you work with them in the `driver`.

But then we'd also need to namespace the events you register, which is weird...

This would potentially work better through for things like `projectId` which isn't actually part of the configuration of cypress and could live outside of `config`.

The first assertion passes but the second assertion fails. This is because it looks for `article span` instead of `span`.

Cypress cannot take a 4K screenshot because the viewport dimensions are capped at 3000px (width or height).

### Desired behavior:

Cypress should be able to create a 4K viewport and take screenshots of it since 4K screen are common nowadays.

494208915,unhelpful error message when taking screenshot of element with zero height,"### Current behavior:

`cy.get(element).screenshot()` displays a very confusing error if the element has zero height.

```
TypeError: Cannot destructure property `duration` of 'undefined' or 'null'.
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/477907/64983051-3f8d8500-d885-11e9-994d-b2051b72e585.png)

#### The code that is causing the confusing error

`numScreenshots` ends up being zero when `elPosition.height` is zero.

https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/c0962511f045f07f2dc255b251ac251b2d8ae718/packages/driver/src/cy/commands/screenshot.coffee#L138

Which causes `takeScreenshot().then()` to receive an undefined `props` parameter that it cannot destructure with `{ duration, path, size } = props;`.

https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/c0962511f045f07f2dc255b251ac251b2d8ae718/packages/driver/src/cy/commands/screenshot.coffee#L357

### Desired behavior:

`cy.get(element).screenshot()` should report an error that the element has zero height.

It is also extremely difficult to troubleshoot an error like this because bluebirdjs doesn't automatically log exceptions, so I have no idea where the code in the error message existed.

It appears that bluebirdjs has events for unhandled errors. It would be great if Cypress provided a filename and line number of the where the error is occurring in the Cypress log as well as a stack trace in the browser console.

http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/api/error-management-configuration.html

```js
process.on(""unhandledRejection"", function(reason, promise) {
});
process.on(""rejectionHandled"", function(promise) {
});
```

### Steps to reproduce: (app code and test code)

You can recreate the confusing error message by trying to take a screenshot of a `span` with zero height.

```js
cy.get('.zero_height_element').screenshot();
```

### Current behavior:

There is no way to catch failed commands in a Cypress test. Any failed command fails the entire test. If you want to catch a failed command for a legitimate reason, ugly workarounds must be used: percy/percy-cypress#140

### Desired behavior:

Add `cy.catch` command which can be chained to any Cypress command, and will be short-circuited to if an error is thrown in the chain preceding it.

479150237,Support ansi color parsing in command log API,"Currently, we only support rendering markdown using `Cypress.log` (and cy.log by extension).

It would be nice to support ansi coloring which could allow for much richer logging for messages and plugins, **while still allowing compatibility between command log, browser console, and node console**

This would allow users to use something like `chalk` to create colored custom logs via `Cypress.log` or `cy.log` that will render everywhere.

474527188,[feature request] Allow setting `--record` switch with env var,"<!-- Is this a question? Don't open an issue. Ask in our chat https://on.cypress.io/chat  -->

### Current behavior:

Right now you can specify Project ID and key with env vars (`CYPRESS_PROJECT_ID`, `CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY`). But you do need to use CLI `--record` switch to actually make use of them. If you use `--record` flag without those env vars you get error:

```
You passed the --record flag but this project has not been setup to record.

This project is missing the 'projectId' inside of 'cypress.json'.

We cannot uniquely identify this project without this id.

You need to setup this project to record. This will generate a unique 'projectId'.

Alternatively if you omit the --record flag this project will run without recording.

https://on.cypress.io/recording-project-runs
```

This makes it challenging (or messy) to use scripts that would work when those env vars are set and when they are not. In our setup we want to record runs to dashboard only when run in CI and not when running them locally (to not pollute dashboard with any test runs that devs will run locally when testing their changes.

As solution/workaround we use scripts like `""cy:run"": ""(is-ci && cypress run --browser chrome --record) || cypress run --browser chrome""` to apply `--record` switch only in CI. ( https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/16190 )

### Desired behavior:

I'd like to be able to use env var like `CYPRESS_RECORD=true` to control all recording related options with env vars.

Cypress 3.4.0, Django 2.0.2

### More info

This is supposedly caused by a [bug][1] in Django development web server, which was fixed in [`2.1.4`][2]. Before this fix Django unconditionally closed the connection after the first request.

The thing is at `3.3.0` Cypress switched to [`keep-alive` connections][3], so now it tries to do a second request (to the URL it was given to in the first one) over the same connection. But at about the same time Django closes the connection, which results in the error in the title.

![][4]

I'm going to confirm in the near future if switching to the latest Django handles the issue.

Then, there's an open issue in Python's [`requests`][5] library (which is not used here, but still), that claims that a client that doesn't establish a new connection in this case is not well-behaved. And there are [open][6] [issues][7] in `request` package which Cypress uses. So the bug seems to be on the client side as well. Or rather on the client side. I'm not sure.

However, it seems to yield the last subject in the `within` function. Only an empty `within` function will yield the subject from the previous command.

### Desired behavior:

Not sure if the documentation or the implementation is wrong. Depending on that, the documentation or the implementation should be fixed.

### Steps to reproduce: (app code and test code)

```html
<article class='post'>
  <h1>My Blog Post</h1>
</article>
```

```javascript
cy
.get('article')
.within(() => {
  cy.get('h1')
})
.should('have.class', 'post')
```

This fails because the `within` yields the `h1` instead of the `article`.

465826635,Cypress should fire 'mouseenter' event on .click(),"### Current behavior:

I have a custom dropdown with checkboxes. I'm using [vue-on-click-outside lib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-on-click-outside). It's a directive vue.js. When I click outside of my dropdown it's close the dropdown. 

In real life, everything is successful. It's opening when I click on the DOM element and when I click outside, it's closing. 

But with Cypress, when I click the dropdown doesn't show. When I remove the directive, the click works. Obviously, I can't close it when I click outside without the directive.

_My component_

```html
<div class=""checkbox-select"" v-on-click-outside=""closeDropdown"">
    <div class=""checkbox-select trigger"" :class=""{ isActive: dropdown }"" @click=""toggleDropdown"" data-testid=""displayDropdown"">

      <span v-show=""dropdown"" class=""checkbox-select title"" data-testid=""titleOpenedDropdown"">TITLE</span>

1- `npm install vue-on-click-outside --save`
2- Add it on something you can toggle open/close

          </div>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  import { mixin as onClickOutside } from 'vue-on-click-outside';

  export default {
    name: 'input-dropdownCheckboxes',
    mixins: [onClickOutside],
    props: {
      items: {
        type: Array,
        default: []
      }
    },
    data() {
      return {
        dropdown: false
      };
    },
    methods: {
      toggleDropdown() {
        this.dropdown = !this.dropdown;

          this.dropdown = false;
        }
      }
    }
  };
</script>
```

3- Try to click on this element with cypress to open it.

```js

  cy.getByTestId(""displayDropdown"").should('be.visible').click()
    .getByTestId(""titleOpenedDropdown"").should(""be.visible"");

465366236,`within` followed by `should` permanently limits scope,"### Current behavior:

When `within` is used to find and return some element within some other element and then followed by `should` to test the returned element, this breaks _all_ subsequent commands (all, not just in the same chain) by permanently setting the root to the aforementioned other element.

In other words, `cy.get('#scope').within(() => cy.get(…)).should(…)` breaks the rest of the test, because it makes it impossible to find anything outside `#scope`.

### Desired behavior:

`cy.get(…).within(() => cy.get(…)).should(…)` shouldn't impact subsequent commands at all. E.g. `cy.get(…)` used after it should search the entire document as usual.

### Steps to reproduce: (app code and test code)

```html
<div id=""foo""><p>foo</p></div>
```

```javascript
cy.root().should('match', 'html') // passes, as it always should

cy.get('#foo')
  .within(() => cy.get('p')) // returns `#foo p`
  .should('match', 'p') // passes, but causes the scope of preceding `within` to become global

cy.root().should('match', 'html') // fails! root is still `div#foo`
```

464629307,Cypress is not able to clean /screenshots,"### Current behavior:

On every run, cypress will clean it's screenshots folder (as mentioned in the documentation). Unfortunately on Windows it is likely that the filenames are too long and thus can not be deleted. When cypress tries to do this, it ignores those files. 
We take all screenshots after the test runs and publish them as build artifacts. So this is a problem as we always see old screenshots.

### Desired behavior:

Cypress should be able to delete them anyway.

I will use a own build step that uses ""rimraf"" to do this. maybe cypress should include rimraf or similar for this task?

- Update to the most recent version of Cypress: https://on.cypress.io/changelog
- Clear your cache by running `cypress cache clear`
- Try to run `cypress verify` BY ITSELF (not `cypress open` or `cypress run`)
- Ensure dependencies are installed `sudo apt-get install xvfb libgtk2.0-0 libnotify-dev libgconf-2-4 libnss3 libxss1 libasound2`
",bug
462349455,Create ability to mock server requests,"### Current behavior:
As described [here](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/588), Cypress doesn't have the ability to get involved with the server process as it stands - it's just about the client. In a bid to ensure that my test environment is as identical as possible to my prod environment, I find the suggestion of rendering on the client just for the sake of tests to be less than ideal.

### Desired behavior:
It'd be awesome if we were provided instructions on how to make our server make requests through the same network proxy layer that Cypress works or if Cypress could provide some kind of plugin to handle that.

### Versions
All",enhancement
462340733,"""Cypress verification timed out"" occurs sporadically in CI","This occurs only in our gitlab CI environment, failing about half the time. I've compared the successful and unsuccessful log output but it looks identical up until the line where it fails. I'm not sure how to debug any further from here. I have cypress caching configured for these examples but it happens without anything cached also.

462313455,Feature request: Button to disable Hot-Reload temporarly,"<!-- Is this a question? Don't open an issue. Ask in our chat https://on.cypress.io/chat  -->

### Current behavior:

In dev mode, when I edit my code and unfocus the IDE the file gets auto saved and the cypress test runs again automatically. That is overall a great feature.
But a frequent usecase is to copy stuff from the current result into the IDE and while doing that, the page reloads and one has to wait until it finishs, scroll to the desired position again, copy the line, insert it into the IDE... and for the next all this happens again.

<!-- images, stack traces, etc -->

### Desired behavior:

So it would be very nice to have another button on top (e.g. next to the ""Disable Auto-Scrolling"") to be able to temorarly disable this hot-reload auto-re-run test behaviour.

<!-- A clear concise description of what you want to happen -->

Open cypress in dev mode, run a test, edit the test and save the test file.

462131340,Feature Request: Make retryOnStatusCodeFailure and retryOnNetworkFailure globally configurable,"### Current behavior:

The two params `retryOnStatusCodeFailure` and `retryOnNetworkFailure` are options passed in via `cy.request` and `cy.visit` - however, it would be great if these two settings are configurable globally as well as overridable per call.

### Desired behavior:

1. Users are able to to configure `retryOnStatusCodeFailure` and `retryOnNetworkFailure` in the Cypress config file.

2. Users are able to override the default settings in the Cypress config file via `cy.request` and `cy.visit`

### Steps to reproduce: (app code and test code)

`cy.visit(some_url, {retryOnStatusCodeFailure:some_value, retryOnNetworkFailure: some_value}`

The elements are found correctly but it seems the focus could not change.

461873210,"When downloading 2 versions of Cypress simultaneously, one clobbers the other resulting in nondescript error and exit","### Current behavior: 

We recently encountered an error on one of our repos ourselves where we use yarn. The problem was that we were downloading two versions of cypress within our `package.json`. We run a monorepo, so one of the cypress versions was in the main `package.json` and the other cypress version was in a sub-module of our monorepo. 

Since we save cypress upon download to `/tmp/cypress.zip`, they were clobbering each other when both were being downloaded/unzipping at the same time. Due to how yarn works, this is likely to exhibit more frequently in it - although it's still possible using npm.

**Note: This can still happen even if the 2 Cypress versions are the same version number**

Basically:

- Version 1 and 2 of Cypress begin download
- Version 1 of Cypress finishes download
- Version 2 of Cypress is still downloading - deleting current `/tmp/cypress.zip`
- Version 1 of Cypress begins unzipping `/tmp/cypress.zip`

455923915,cy.route() unable to mock same url multiple times if requests happen quickly,"### Current behavior:

If you make multiple requests to the same endpoint and want to mock each response differently based on the order that they occur, cypress appears to be unable to do it unless you wait X milliseconds between requests.  If there is no pause between requests, cypress will never catch the first `cy.wait(...)` and will mock every request to that endpoint with the same response.

### Desired behavior:

```js
cy.server()
cy.route(url, res1).as(get)
cy.wait(@get)
cy.route(url, res2).as(get)

Should result in the first GET request to url responding with res1 and the second GET request to url responding with res2, regardless of the amount of time between requests.

455117036,Add more advanced screenshot clipping options,"<!-- Is this a question? Don't open an issue. Ask in our chat https://gitter.im/cypress-io/cypress-->

### Current behavior:

When creating a screenshot you can pass an options object with a clip option which accepts an x, y, width and height setting defining the absolute position that you want the screenshot to be clipped to.

### Desired behavior:

I’d like to see the clipping options be extended to support relative or calculated coordinates. For example, the following could define a screenshot the viewport dimensions but inset by 50px.

```js
cy.screenshot({ capture: “viewport”, clip: { inset: 50 } });
```

Or when screenshotting an element, allow offsetting it’s coordinates to capture 20px of its surrounding area.

```js
cy.get(“#myId”).screenshot({ clip: { offset: 20 });
```

My use case for this is mostly to use cypress for automating documentation screenshots, but I’m sure it could have uses within the testing arena.

454820121,Allow using external Node when running tasks / plugins,"## Proposal

Currently, the plugins file is executed using the Node.js version included with Cypress Test Runner (like 8.2.1), which is often not the version needed to run the application. The most common problem is the inability to load native extensions when requiring NPM modules from the plugins file. The installed app for example uses Node 10 to compile extensions, while Cypress tries to load them using Node 8

So instead of using built-in Node version in `packages/server/lib/plugins/index.coffee`

```
pluginsProcess = cp.fork(path.join(__dirname, ""child"", ""index.js""),
   [""--file"", config.pluginsFile], { stdio: ""inherit"" })
```

we could find external Node and launch it as a child process

When there is an input within HTML that is covered by a parent element with the css property of `visibility :hidden`, Cypress interprets this as non-actionable and does not allow typing. 

I can, however, type into the input when typing `tab` on my keyboard with the element coming into focus from there. I tried working around this by doing `cy.get('input').focus().type('John')`, but it still fails saying the element is not visible.

**Use case:** I have some generic requests to complete when opening a new view, like fetching some data-Types from my backend. Therefore i created a very generic cy.route and added cy.wait n-times. This happens some times in my tests, so is added a custom cypress command, which does the magic for me:
```js
/**
 * Helper method to wait for some requests to occur.
 *
 * @func cy.waitTimes
 * @param alias - {string|number} the alias or seconds to wait for
 * @param count - {number} number of times to wait for
 */
Cypress.Commands.add('waitTimes', (alias, count) => {
    // decrease count till 0, which is falsy
    for (; count; count--) {
        cy.wait(alias);
    }
});
```
**Usage:** 
```js
// ...
cy.server();
cy.route('GET', /.*\/data\/.*/).as('dataRequest');
cy.waitTimes('@dataRequest', 4);
```

Maybe you like the idea as I do. For me it was more useful to add waitTimes as command, but feel free to add 'count' to options of cy.wait, if this more the official cypress way.

452065961,Problem with http-to-https redirects behind corporate proxy,"### Current behavior:

I'm trying to test the following page with cypress 3.3.1:

```html
<script src=""//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/underscore.js/1.8.3/underscore.js""></script>
<script>_.assign()</script>
<script src=""//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bluebird@3.5.5/js/browser/bluebird.min.js""></script>
<script>Promise.config({ longStackTraces: true });</script>
```

* I am serving this page under `http://localhost:3000/` (not https!)
* I am behind a corporate proxy in which both `http_proxy` and `https_proxy` have the exact same value of the form `http://username:password@proxy_host:port`. Note that even the `https_proxy` value is `http`, not `https` (I am not sure this matters, but I thought I should give as much potentially relevant information as possible)

### Desired behavior:

It should work, but instead I get the following error:

```
Uncaught TypeError: Promise.config is not a function

This error originated from your application code, not from Cypress.

When Cypress detects uncaught errors originating from your application it will automatically fail the current test.

This behavior is configurable, and you can choose to turn this off by listening to the 'uncaught:exception' event.

https://on.cypress.io/uncaught-exception-from-application
```

### Notes

This indicates that something went wrong when fetching the bluebird script (while the underscore script was fetched fine).

Amazingly, replacing `//cdn.jsdelivr.net` with `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net` makes it work, while replacing with `http://cdn.jsdelivr.net` gives the same error.

Since `http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/` yields a 301 REDIRECT to `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/`, I thought this redirect was causing the problem. But as it can be seen, the bluebird script was fetched correctly, and `http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/` also redirects to `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/`, so I am lost.

Although I've found this very simple workaround, I thought I should file this issue because, well, fetching with `//` instead of `https://` should work, simply because it works outside cypress. Perhaps this indicates a deeper problem, and other not-so-simple situations might not have this workaround possible.

### Steps to reproduce: (app code and test code)

I couldn't just fork https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-test-tiny to show the problem because there wouldn't be the corporate proxy issue. But I believe the description above is enough. Let me know if any clarification is needed.

451776124,allow live-reload out of paused debugger,"#### what
When chrome is paused on a debugger breakpoint, the filewatching/livereload currently does not refesh changes until you resume execution:

_when chrome is like this, live-reloading doesn't work until you click resume_
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14625260/58848301-058cd000-8654-11e9-84a1-a23030781bc0.png)


It would be nice to expose the option to allow file changes to re-run tests even when the browser is paused on a debugger breakpoint

#### how
we could do this by 
- using the `native debugging protocols` to temporarily disable breakpoints and resume from execution until we are able to re-run cypress tests
**or**
- simply doing a hard refresh of the page using the native protocols or extensions API

451536370,Proposal: insert fixes for basic errors right from the Test Runner,"## Background

I have shown Cypress Test Runner at a company where my friend works, and then had to wait in their office for an hour until the end of the work day. While sitting at one of the desks, I have noticed a person next to me writing a Cypress test - trying it out on their website. He is a front end developer, who loved the demo and immediately wanted to replace a few existing tests. 

Their site polyfills `fetch` which caused Cypress test to crash due to `XMLHttpRequest` property missing (when we try to wrap it for XHR stubbing). I saw his reaction - he clicked on the link in the error message https://on.cypress.io/uncaught-exception-from-application which took him to this doc

<img width=""792"" alt=""Screen Shot 2019-06-03 at 10 55 10 AM"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2212006/58811598-160a5f80-85ee-11e9-9f1f-9e5efb272b00.png"">

He did NOT follow the link. I was next to him so I jumped into the situation, clicking on the link and explaining to him what happens. The first event on the page shows the workaround

<img width=""557"" alt=""Screen Shot 2019-06-03 at 10 56 02 AM"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2212006/58811653-376b4b80-85ee-11e9-987d-828e9534ed38.png"">

Without me there observing it, he would be blocked. After we added the workaround, he wrote several tests, absolutely happy as a clam

## Proposal

We know the spec, we know the place with `cy.visit`, we show the specific error message. We could add a button to the error message with something like ""Add workaround"". When the user clicks it, we can add our handler to the spec file.

```js
Cypress.on('uncaught:exception', (err, runnable) => {
  // returning false here prevents Cypress from
  // failing the test due to uncaught exceptions from the production code
  return false
})
```

We could even target the handler by only handling that specific error

The purpose is not to create a universal solution, but to avoid people being blocked 100% when they try writing their first ""hello Cypress"" test. We could probably insert typical solution for
- uncaught exception from the website under test
- chrome security: false
- ignore missing content type or non-200 response from the server

I think this work can only happen after the in progress error improvements land (issue #3762, pull request #3930)

### Desired behavior:

No error

### Steps to reproduce: (app code and test code)

This happens intermittently but very often on 3.3.1. If you log off and on again it is fine.

If you switch back to cypress 3.3.0, even without logging off it is fine.

```
$ env | grep -i proxy

NO_PROXY=undefined
HTTPS_PROXY=

450907197,Cypress' cy.wait() does not wait on redirect,"### Current behavior:

I'm writing a test to cover our registration flow. 

On creating an account, user gets redirected to a `/registration` page where I then try to validate that a `send confirmation email` button exists. 

We have bunch of `GET` requests made on redirect on registration page, which causes a complete load of 'registration' page pretty long (I would say 5-7s?).

Of course, this caused the test became really 'flaky', so I decided to wait for those api routes to be resolved before proceeding to next commands, but it seems like the commands are getting executed and timing out before `cy.wait` gets resolved.

Custom command, wait for api: 

```js
Cypress.Commands.add('waitForApiResponse', function (url) {
    cy.server();
    cy.route('GET', '**/internal**/**').as('internalApi');
    cy.wait('@internalApi');
});
```

Actual test: 

```js
cy.get(vendorRegSelectors.vendorRegCreateButton).click();
cy.waitForApiResponse();

cy.location('pathname').should('eq', '/registration');
cy.get(vendorRegSelectors.sendConfirmEmailButton)
  .invoke('width')
  .should('be.gt', 0);
```

### Desired behavior:

Next commands of `cy.wait()` should not be executed until `cy.wait()` resolves successfully.

Now, I know that we can't wait FOREVER to grab requests that are being made within the app...

Would there really be a no other solution instead of increasing `timeout`?

450844267,option to disable scroll per command (Auto scroll on click/trigger can break virtual grids),"<!-- Is this a question? Don't open an issue. Ask in our chat https://gitter.im/cypress-io/cypress-->

### Current behavior:

Cypress click will scroll an element inside a virtual grid to the top.

However in between the scroll and triggering the click, the virtual grid can hear the scroll, then change which dom row corresponds to which data row (usually in virtual grids, in order that mobile scrolling works you have a window of real dom nodes and upon a scroll you move the data and then the y position of the rows so that the user can continue seamlessly scrolling).

This means that day the grid is rows 1-7 and you get 3.. the trigger is executed on the same dom element that was fetched, but because of the scroll it has become a row containing the data in 5.

Because of race conditions, this usually ends up being intermittent depending on if cypress or the scroll listener wins.

<!-- images, stack traces, etc -->

### Desired behavior:

I’d love to be able to disable scroll per command or else entirely so it has to be explicit (better I think for an spa)

Well, this is the question that requires investigating. I don't have more information than this error occurs sometimes. 

### Versions

Cypress 3.1.0+

### Some relevant existing issues?

- The Chromium file/line where this is throwing: https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/webrtc/+/master/media/engine/adm_helpers.cc#74
- Electron, but in 1.7/1.8 version, so shouldn't affect 3.3.0+ https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/10455

# HELP NEEDED

If you are seeing this error, please help us fix it 😄 

- What OS/environment are you running this in? Is it only during `cypress run`? Is it only in CI?
- Can you provide more information on what test code you ran exactly when this happened? Does it happen in the same spot each time?
- Can you run your tests with `cypress open`, choose the Electron browser, open DevTools where this error occurs? What is logged here? Please provide.
- Could you run Cypress in [debug mode](https://on.cypress.io/debugging#Debug-the-Command-Line) mode and print the logs here?

When I remove all the proxy env. variables everything is working.

`NO_PROXY` should be considered.

### Steps to reproduce: (app code and test code)

Set env. variables `HTTP_PROXY` + `HTTPS_PROXY` to a valid proxy.
Set the domain of the `baseUrl` as value for the env. variable `NO_PROXY`.
Run the tests.

447898025,Delayed 304 responses when using proxy,"### Current behaviour:

When a page loads resources, and the resources have been loaded before, the web server returns a 304 response. When running Cypress without proxy, this works fine. When running Cypress with proxy, there is a 5 second delay before the response reaches the browser.

### Desired behavior:

There should be no additional delay on 304 responses with a proxy.

### Steps to reproduce: (app code and test code)

I have created a minimal demo for the issue. Please see:
[https://github.com/bjowes/delayed-response-demo](https://github.com/bjowes/delayed-response-demo)

The README contains instruction on using the demo.

In this simplistic case, the tests still pass. In my real scenario I am testing an Angular app with many more resources. The tests fail nearly every time due to timeout caused by delayed 304 responses.

### Versions

Tested with Cypress 3.3.1 on Windows 10 and OS X 10.14.4. 
Browser: Chrome v74.
Also tried in headless mode with Electron 61.
I haven't double checked but I believe the behaviour has been present at least since Cypress 3.1.0.

### Comment

Since the proxy I use is made by me (and based on the [`node-http-mitm-proxy` library](https://github.com/joeferner/node-http-mitm-proxy)), I realise that the error may lie in the proxy itself. However, I have verified that using Chrome with my proxy but without Cypress works just fine.

The only thing the `node-http-mitm-proxy` does to the traffic is setting `transfer-encoding` to `chunked` and removing the `content-length` header (if any). I have observed that if I remove this in the case of 304 response (which has no content) it works fine. Hence I presume there is some issue related to `chunked` encoding consisting of only an empty chunk.

Personally I can live with my workaround but I believe that it is not an unusual approach by proxies to always set `transfer-encoding` on responses to `chunked`, especially those that allow modification of the content.",bug
447864450,Screenshot directory names should not contain spec file extensions such as `.js`,"### Current behavior:

Screenshots are written to directories that directly match the spec file name (including the extension) which creates confusing directory names that look like files:
```
cypress/screenshots

└── login.spec.js
    └── login.png

### Desired behavior:

Directory names should not have the `.js` file extension in their name. And for extra credit, an ending `.spec` or `_spec` should also be removed like so:

```

447484632,Not able to interact with the Hammer.js tap event,"### Context

We are trying to perform automated testing for a web application based on Angular 5. Due to the web app must be accessible through mobile and tablet devices, we use [Hammer.js](https://hammerjs.github.io/) in order to be able to handle some gesture-based events.

### Current behavior:

Cypress is not able to click on a button that is listening the Hammer.js ""tap"" event. When clicking, the handler is not executed. On the other hand, the user has no problem to interact by using the mouse click event.

### Desired behavior:

The behaviour should be the same as the expected when the click event is used otherwise we cannot use Cypress in order to ""simulate"" the user interaction with the UI.

We successfully tested with other automation tools based on Selenium webdriver but we are interested on migrating our automated tests to Cypress. Nevertheless, this issue is blocking for us.

446591472,Using auth option in visit method sets authorization headers in all subrequests,"### Current behavior:

We have overridden Visit method and adding there auth option (because app we are testing is behind basic http auth). But these headers are sent NOT ONLY to page which is defined in visit method, but also to all sub requests, like for example images and js, which are loaded on page. Is this normal behaviour? Because we have problems with CDN, which is just refusing requests with such header.

### Desired behavior:

I would expect authorization header is sent only to defined visit page, not to all requests on page.

### Steps to reproduce: (app code and test code)

It seems this is done inside cypress proxy, because if you take a look inside browser there is no header in requests, but if you see logs on server, there is actually Authorization header.

445537814,Sticky elements within a fixed container are not properly taken into account when scrolling to an element,"### Current behavior:
This bug is related to #565 / #571

A typical use case for fixed containers are modals which fully overlay an application. In our case the fixed container is used to dim the application while displaying a modal or side panel within said container. The content within the dimmed overlay container is scrollable, but the container itself is not. I was able to break the test for #565 by making minimal adjustments to the fixture, which is included in the test repo.

As soon as a sticky element is nested within a fixed container, Cypress scrolls the element too far, so it ends up below the sticky header. 

![sticky elements -- additional example with side panel -- can click the first tr (failed)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3470207/57944499-3a073a80-78a5-11e9-9848-2897b5e59f35.png)
![sticky elements -- issue 565571 with updated fixture -- can click the first tr (failed)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3470207/57944500-3a073a80-78a5-11e9-8696-7f2295434da9.png)

### Desired behavior:
Cypress should take sticky headers into account when scrolling, even when they are within a fixed element and clicking on an element should succeed.

### Steps to reproduce: (app code and test code)
A repo (based on https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-test-tiny) containing two failing test cases can be found at https://github.com/johanneslumpe/cypress-sticky-header-bug

When Cypress detects a `baseUrl` set in `cypress.json` it will initially verify this before running the tests.

The problem is that it will **instantly** fail and exit if this server is not accessible.

### Desired behavior:

Retry connecting to `baseUrl` multiple times, so that servers that are booting or experience a tiny hiccup do not cause run failures.

## Current behavior:
Currently, I am running a ```beforeEach``` and it resets at the beginning of each test which is what I want but also no. I have tests that are independent but grouped together because they are testing the same component. So, for now it looks like this: 
```js
describe('this is a test',function(){
	it('will be a test example',function(){
		cy.contains('test').click
		cy.contains('another test').click()
	})
})
```

```js
beforeEach(() => {
  cy.visit('http://localhost:3000/');
});

	it('will test another test',function(){
		cy.contains('another test').click()

439051087,Add ability to use .should (without callback) without retry,"<!-- Is this a question? Don't open an issue. Ask in our chat https://gitter.im/cypress-io/cypress-->

### Current behavior:

`.should` is always retrying the previous command which can be undesired in some scenarios. For example when calling an api to check that an action on the app did change the data, we usually do something like:
```js
// ...
.request(...)
.its('body')
.should('deep.equal', expectedResult)
```

in this example, if the assertion fails then Cypress will retry the `its` until it times out. Which is useless since `.its('body')` will always return the same value.
### Desired behavior:

I'm not sure what's the best way to optimize this use case. My current workaround is to replace `.should` with:
```js
.then(body => expect(body).to.deep.equal(expectedResult))
```
Ideally, Cypress would be smart enough to avoid retries in this situation. If that is not possible, then maybe adding a `.assert` with same api as `.should` but without retry?

437172548,Disable flag options for fake camera UI,"### Current behavior:

Hi I have been writing some tests to verify ID verification process during a specific user journey. There are 2 parts to this process - 1. is it to upload a file for example passport and 2. is to capture/upload a selfie image. The problem i am encountering with cypress is that it switches ON the fake camera by default and i am struggling to upload an image or to send out a video file(which I dont want to do) I just want to basically skip this fake camera input and use the upload function. Is there any way I can do this by passing something like ""--disable--fake-video-capture"". If you need any more info let me know.

### Desired behavior:

 I can see that its been passed as flag to chrome from this script

437045630,"Support creating custom assertion operator like 'should('have.text.trimmed', ...)'","Cypress have many assertion operators like 'eq', 'contain', 'have.text', but which is not enough for me.

```js
cy.get('.cell')
  .then($cell => $cell.text().trim())
  .should('eq', 'Hello')

Since none of `have.text`, `eq`, `contain` really work in this case.

433847723,Incorrect redirect to malformed url within AUT - adding `_/` in url,"<!-- Is this a question? Don't open an issue. Ask in our chat https://gitter.im/cypress-io/cypress-->

### Current behavior:
When I instruct cypress to login to an Oracle APEX application, the authentication re-directs cypress to a '404 not found' page because the authenticated URL is malformed. The malformed URL is the only issue and can simply corrected programmatically (with a find and replace command).
![Screen Shot 2019-04-15 at 10 14 48 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12301835/56223200-29ec0900-6022-11e9-83c7-d2fff85d2fab.png)

However - it is very important to note that the cypress login correctly returns:
1. a valid cookie
2. a valid session

which is everything you need for authentication.



<!-- images, stack traces, etc -->

### Desired behavior:

Cypress, ideally, should be able to follow the same authentication redirect that a user would in a regular browser. 
<!-- A clear description of what you want to happen -->

### Steps to reproduce: (app code and test code)

I created a dummy application with dummy credentials hosted by apex.oracle.com to demonstrate:
```js
it('Login demo', function() {
    cy.visit('https://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=54707:LOGIN_DESKTOP')
    cy.get('#P9999_USERNAME').type('ApexUser')
    cy.get('#P9999_PASSWORD').type('Oradoc_db1')
    cy.get('.t-Button').click()
  })
```
The above code (which should work until the application expires in many months) will redirect to a 404 not found page with a url in the format: 
https://apex.oracle.com/__/f?p=54707:1:[session_id]:::::
Outside of cypress the url will have the format:
https://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=54707:1:[session_id]:::::

432012188,data-react-beautiful-dnd-draggable does not work with cypress drag and drop command,"Hi,

I have been trying to understand why the mouse/keyboard cypress commands don't work with the 'data-react-beautiful-dnd-draggable' in react for a web application we have developed. I am running the cypress tests on Chrome on an element of type 'form'.

I am attempting to drag and drop a series of text boxes by swapping them with each other. These text boxes can be identified using 'form id=X'. The text boxes also have a 'data-position' attribute. On drag and drop these text boxes should fire an API call that gets the text boxes reordered but so far had no luck actually moving the textboxes around.

I have tried the following approaches:
- dnd plugin 
- following the cypress dnd recipe
- using keyboard actions such as keyDown/keyUp
- using dragstart,dragend,mouseover,mousedown

This is a snippet of the code I was running:
Keyboard actions:

```javascript
describe(""Reorder text boxes"", () => {
    it(""should reorder textboxes"", function() {
      cy.wait(2000);
      cy.get(""div[class*=index_banner]:nth-child(2)"")
        .focus()
        .trigger(""space"", { keyCode: space, force: true })
        .trigger(""keyup"", { keyCode: arrowUp, force: true })
        .wait(5000)
        .trigger(""space"", { keyCode: space, force: true });
      });
  });
```


Mouse actions:
```javascript
              cy.get(`form[id=309]`)
              .parent() // locates dnd-react component
              .focus()           
              .trigger('mousedown', { clientX: 338 , clientY: 268 })              
              .trigger('mousemove', { clientX: 338 , clientY: 262 })

431926734,Config routes with no response fail to be recognised as a route,"### Current behavior:

If we try to create the following route:

```javascript
cy.route({
  method: 'GET',

```

This is failed to be picked up by Cypress as a valid route:

```javascript
cy.wait('@someRoute'); // The route is not recognised, so this assertion will fail
```

The current workaround for this is to provide an empty response object, which is technically not correct behaviour, as this particular route does not return any response (not even an empty JSON payload):

```javascript
cy.route({
  method: 'GET',
  url: '**/some-route',

When you write assertions outside of a test (failing & passing), Cypress throws an error ""cannot read 'id' of undefined"" 

This is being thrown when attempting to create the logs for a test when the runnable is undefined. 

Furthermore, Cypress attempts to iterate over the stylesheets of the current document. Since there is no document, this throws an error that it ""cannot read 'stylesheets' of undefined""

### Desired behavior:

When you write assertions outside of a test (failing & passing), Cypress should handles these correctly.

- Failing assertions should warn that you have a failure outside of a proper test - that you should probably write a test to put your assertions into.

If your HTML happens to have whitespace in the tag, e.g., `<div> foo  </div>`, that text will not impact how the user sees the page, unless it is a `<pre>` element. I don't think that the `'have.text'` assertion should fail just because it found `' foo '` when it was expecting `'foo'`.

If you're not willing to change this (since it is technically a breaking change), maybe there should be a `have.text.trimmed`?

### Current behavior:

`should('have.text', ...)` fails if the HTML contains whitespace, even if that whitespace doesn't impact the rendered content.

### Desired behavior:

    }).should('be.visible');
  });

  it('Clicks Submit Button', () => {
    cy.get('[data-cy=""submit-button""]').click();
  });
});
```

The login part uses JWT, anyway that part works fine. It then visits the route `/form` and views the form element. This form is only visible to logged-in users, I can clearly see that at this point the user is logged in, I can see that from the UI showing the user's name. So far so good. Then in the last step, a button is clicked which triggers a `POST` requests, which passes the authorization token retrieved from the first step.

This part fails because for some reason I can't figure out, by the time it reaches the 3rd step, the user is no longer logged in, and as such the authorization token is not included with the `POST` request.

This ""flow"" works fine if you run it manually.

Now, if I run all 3 steps as a single `it()`, then it works correctly

```js
describe('Logs In and Submits Form', () => {
  it('Mocks Login, sees form, clicks submit button', () => {
    cy.mockLoginAndGoto('form');

    cy.get('form', {
      timeout: 5000,
    }).should('be.visible');

    cy.get('[data-cy=""submit-button""]').click();
  });
});
```

This works correctly. How come? What am I missing?

This is a simplified version of the real test. The real test involves logging in, testing a bunch of steps then at the end clicking the submit button and submitting a form that's been filled out by the previous steps. I don't want to have to mock the login before each of those steps. I also don't want to have to eliminate all my steps and run 20 sets of directives as a single `it()`.

Why is it that all steps keep my user logged in but when I reach the step that causes a `POST` request, only then does it fail and reverts my state to logged-out? But as a single `it()` it works?

They all come up with some sort of error about a promise inside a promise or something...

CypressError: Timed out retrying: Cypress detected that you returned a promise from a command while also invoking one or more cy commands in that promise.

The command that returned the promise was:

  > cy.type()

The cy command you invoked inside the promise was:

  > cy.rerender()

Because Cypress commands are already promise-like, you don't need to wrap them or return your own promise.

Cypress will resolve your command with whatever the final Cypress command yields.

The reason this is an error instead of a warning is because Cypress internally queues commands serially whereas Promises execute as soon as they are invoked. Attempting to reconcile this would prevent Cypress from ever resolving.

423278718,Conditional testing of DOM elements,"Hello!

Hope you are having a beautiful day!

Please do not make framework usability for developers more complex, because you have some vision, that is theoretically backed, but in practice makes life really hard.

Scenario:
1. A list of input fields is generated
2. Last input field OTP field is conditionally rendering depending of fraud calculation result (So in one test it might be there, in next not)

Why it is so hard to have:
```js
cy.get('input[field1]'.type('lala');
if (cy.hasElement('input[otp]')) {
  cy.get('input[otp]'.type('lala');
}
```

This document contents is understandable, but I totally disagree - better to have support from you, than investigate how to hack around, so I do not need to rewrite back-end services for tests.
https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/conditional-testing.html#The-problem

**As a developer, I care only that my tests are quick to write and easy to read and debug. With Cypress this is not always the case, because a lot of things are counter-intuitive and require hackish solutions.**

5 Biggest problem for our team in few months of usage:
* A-B scenario testing with if-s is hard.
* Iframe contents testing is badly documented.
* Why Cypress tries to fill input if it is not visible? Find me a visible input instead and fill it. (Example scenario: modal is overlaying something.)
* 3rd party scripts failure causes all CI deployment flow stop and it takes days to find the root issue.
* For multiple domains testing within 1 test, we need to run local reverse proxy.

I understand, that you could say: ""this is feature and ..."", but we have real people, who are trying their best, and different team members stumble up on same issues. So maybe you could help us and future clients? :)

We totally love Cypress and we hope these issues will be fixed in future releases.


Best regards!

I noticed that I can’t run tests with cypress on a site that has scripts obfuscated with domain lock by JavaScript Obfuscator Tool (https://obfuscator.io/). Domain lock is a setting that helps protect scripts from running on other domains. I don’t know how cypress works, so I can’t even think of how can I solve that problem. I saw that it starts with localhost and then it redirects to the real domain, but the scripts fail to work after that. I tried adding localhost as approved domain, but it didn’t help. 
I like your tool, but removing a domain lock just for testing doesn't seem a good idea.

422568450,"cy.get(el).should('match', regex) fails to compare regex against el's innnerText","### Current behavior:

I'm not using the middle `contains` in my tests & I'll use a more interesting regex to check something else. But, for a simple failing case, see:

```js
cy.get('button').contains(/next/i).should('match', /next/i)
```

The above line of my e2e tests fails with the following output:

```
Command:     contains

```

It looks like the `contains` yielded `<span class=​""MuiButton-label-214"">​Next​</span>​` But then the match assertion is only checking `<span class=​""MuiButton-label-214"">​` and not the inner text.

I don't see anything in the [assertion reference](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/assertions.html) that suggests `match` should only be comparing against the element name & classes.

### Desired behavior:

`cy.get(element).should('match', regex)` should compare the regex against the element's inner text too, not just the element name & classes.

Alternatively, I'd like to have some way to assert that some element in an array has an inner text that matches some regex. See issue #3746 for another unsuccessful attempt I made at solving this problem.

422094081,Selecting environment via the deskop appliction,"<!-- Is this a question? Don't open an issue. Ask in our chat https://gitter.im/cypress-io/cypress-->

### Current behavior:
In the UI of Cypress, there is no way of selecting the environment option if we want to run the test case in a different environment. Need to run a special command kind of thing to do it. 
<!-- images, stack traces, etc -->

### Desired behavior:
There should be an option to select the environment for user convenience if user don't want to run any command by rather using the desktop appliction just for checking running test cases. Specially if some one ot that famliar with commnad line things.

@brian-mann commented on [Thu Jun 14 2018](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-api/issues/624#issuecomment-397324414)

The API doesn't actually know whether or not the uploading failed. It just assumes it was all successful.

For us to capture this state we would either need to send it along from the desktop client - or we'd need a lambda function to spawn in response to files being uploaded to buckets - which would then update the DB state.

Although it would be initially easier to do this out of the clients, its unnecessary and much less flexible (it wouldnt work on older versions) and I think we'd rather opt to go the lambda route because we will have to do that **anyway** when we do things like log processing.

421421665,Running test cases in parallel sometimes runs files multiple times,"### Current behavior:

We are running multiple test cases on Gitlab CI. We have 15 machines for our test cases.

Sometimes cypress seems to start different files multiple files. Usually I have 17 specs in the first group:

When running the exact same pipeline, suddenly much more specs are found:

712949833,Feature-Request: support babel.config.js,"### Current behavior:

@cypress/webpack-preprocessor supports Babel out of the box with a [default configuration](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-webpack-preprocessor/blob/c240d71f2b89d18a05aa8b6f0e67cb91d2722d05/index.js#L19-L21):

```js
{
  presets: [require.resolve('@babel/preset-env')],

```

### Desired behavior:

babel@^7.0.0 uses the `babel.config.js` file to configure its presets and plugins. Other libraries like [babel-jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-jest) pick up this configuration automatically. It would be nice if this package would do the same before falling back to its default configuration.

### How to reproduce:

Create an application with a `babel.config.js` that differs from this package's defaults. This package's defaults will be used.

```js
  cy.get('#thing').trigger('mousedown', 10, 10);
```

When the browser creates the `MouseEvent` object, it has a `view` property which points to the `Window` object. 

Cypress does not add it during a `trigger`.

Apparently the `d3-zoom` library depends on this property being there. My app breaks when run via cypress but not when the user clicks.

Here is the property:  
https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/blob/master/lib/lib.dom.d.ts#L15454

```
C:\> wmic datafile where name=""C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe"" get Version /value

Version=72.0.3626.11

However, WMIC was [deprecated in Windows Server 2012](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/hh831568(v=ws.11)#wmi-providers):

> The WMI command-line tool (Wmic) is deprecated. Use PowerShell cmdlets instead.

The WMIC database can also get corrupted, which causes issues for users since this will prevent them from launching browsers (see #3645)

We should probably replace our usage of WMIC with querying [CIM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/WmiSdk/common-information-model), the successor.

Some of my website's HTTP requests are failing only in the Cypress browser (e.g. signing up for a new account). After debugging, it was discovered this was due to the response header returning a different `content-type` in the Cypress browser.

Configuration can be modified through GUI interface

A use case would be:

We have a test suite that checks if all the strings on our web app are translated. 

The test code is the same for any given languages, all we change is the config parameter to select what languages we want to run with. 

Currently, I have to change the config file and restart GUI. It would be great if I can just change config on the GUI and run the test.

416901105,Feature request: let me use aliased values directly as parameters to 'should',"### Desired behavior:

I'd like to reference aliases in `should` parameters.

For example, testing a progress bar, I'd love it if I could write:

```js
  it('updates the progress bar', function() {
      cy.get('progress')
        .then($el => parseFloat($el.attr('value')))
        .as('progress0')
        .should('be.greaterThan', 0);
      cy.wait(2000);
      cy.get('progress')
        .then($el => parseFloat($el.attr('value')))
        .should('be.greaterThan', '@progress0');
  });
```

Instead, I have to implement it like this:

```js
  it('updates the progress bar', function() {
      cy.get('progress')
        .then($el => parseFloat($el.attr('value')))
        .as('progress0')
        .should('be.greaterThan', 0);
      cy.wait(2000).then(function() {
        cy.get('progress')
          .then($el => parseFloat($el.attr('value')))
          .should('be.greaterThan', this.progress0);
      });
  });
```

IMO, the first one is cleaner and doesn't rely on an unnecessary nested `then` function (or on the `this.` syntax which I don't like here).

If course, this would technically be a breaking change, since some users might actually have `'@'` characters at the beginning of the strings they're checking for.
In this case, maybe there'd be some way to escape them (`'@@'` ?)

If this is untenable, I'd settle for something like `cy.ref('@progress0')`.

### Other comments
Maybe ""should"" should wait instead but that fails to find the element as well because page was not fully loaded and/or ""should"" did not wait and/or default timeout for ""should"" was too short?

from the docs
```
When you load your application using cy.visit(), Cypress will wait for the load event
to fire. It is really this easy. The cy.visit() command loads a remote page and does 
not resolve until all of the external resources complete their loading phase.

This might not be a bug per se, but I couldn't [figure out](https://docs.cypress.io/api/plugins/preprocessors-api.html#File-events) how we should properly write a watch plugin. E.g. the [cypress-app-watcher-preprocessor](https://github.com/TheBrainFamily/cypress-app-watcher-preprocessor/blob/master/cypressPreprocessor.js) does it the same.

As a workaround, instead of looping through every open file, I emit the `rerun` on a randomly chosen open file which triggers re-run of everything open, anyway --- but this feels weird.

Each test and folder would have a check box.  Modifying check of folder affects all children folders/tests.

There is button / warning to indicate when your selection deviates from normal and option to clear it in case people have checkbox selected but scroll down and might forget about it.  In worse case I think they would see it trying to run test that had accidentally remained checked, stop the tests, uncheck it and continue.

Ideally `cypress --parallelization=n` should just work.
It could start one headless browser for each threads (or process) and run thread in parallel.

Cypress tests are inherently IO bound (they are interacting with an application.

414372632,Ability to bail running test if previous dependent test failed.,"### Current behavior:
Currently when you run a spec file with multiple test cases, they will all run and report their results of either PASS or FAIL.

After one test finished, the state of that test is left behind. It is quite possible for the next test to continue where the prior test left off. This is all good when the prior test passes, but it is not good when it failed since we don't need to waste time running the subsequent tests because we know they will fail. Which is why the Cypress documentation recommends writing bigger test cases that test more features.

### Desired behavior:

We need some mechanism to NOT run a test when a previous test it depends on fails, and to report it as not having been run.
 
I know the docs for Cypress discourages this practice, as have other test teams using other frameworks I have been on. I myself resisted it for a long time. However my manager insisted that I give it a try and when I did I discovered how elegant it actually was.

Prior to trying this I made bigger test cases that tested many features as it drilled down into the main feature being tested. But when I tried breaking those bigger tests into smaller test ""stages"" as I called them, putting each stage into the `it()` call, I could much more easily see in the test runner UI how the test progressed and at what stage the test failed. Since each stage is comprises of around 3-7 steps, it was much easier to pinpoint exactly where the failure was and in what iteration of the stage if it had been repeated.

Another benefit of this is that these tests became much more self-documenting.

411835964,Error: Failed to parse or set cookie named,"### Current behavior:

When using a cookie with attribute `Secure` using a HTTP connection an error is thrown and tests are aborted:

> Error: Failed to parse or set cookie named ""\<JSESSIONID>"".

For more context, see https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1321#issuecomment-462647518

### Desired behavior:

Cypress should continue to run tests and ignore cookie, perhaps showing a warning about trying to set a secure cookie on a non-secure connection.

### Steps to reproduce: (app code and test code)

1. Use a non-encrypted connection (http)
2. Navigate Cypress to a url which tries to set a `Secure` cookie as response

Cypress 3.1.5 (3.1.0 works fine), any OS, both Electron and Chrome are affected.

411549189,Support login via Google OAuth in Test Runner,"Cypress recently introduced the ability to login to the [Cypress Dashboard via Google](https://www.cypress.io/blog/2019/02/12/new-feature-log-in-to-the-cypress-dashboard-via-google/). While this is great for allowing a wider audience to access the Dashboard, the lack of feature parity with the Test Runner creates some awkwardness ... the requirement for a GitHub account in order to setup a project to record to the Dashboard.",enhancement
411152898,Inject an assertion after the request but before the response,"### Current behavior:

It is very common to have the UI display some kind of spinner or loading message while awaiting a response from an API call. Unfortunately, there is currently no way to ""pause"" a network request so that we can perform assertions before the response is received. The only option is to use a time delay which is flakey and an anti-pattern.

### Desired behavior:

To test this in a non-flaky way, it would be nice to be able to inject an assertion after the event that triggers the request but before the response is received. Something like:

```js
cy.route({
  onBeforeResponse: req => cy.get('[data-test-id=spinner]').should('be.visible') 
 ...
})
```

This would make the state much more deterministic as we would know that the request has been issued but that the response has not yet returned.

It's probably not possible to actually pause a request after it has been issued, but it should be possible to prevent the request from happening until some other event has taken place. For example, this could be implemented internally by wrapping the onBeforeResponse callback in a promise and delaying the request until onBeforeResponse is resolved. That way code like the following would be possible:

```js

cy.route({
  onBeforeResponse: req => cy.get('[data-test-id=spinner]').should('be.visible') 
 ...
}).as('apiCall')
cy.get('#button-that-triggers-apiCall').click()
cy.wait('@apiCall')
cy.get('[data-test-id=spinner]').should('not.be.visible') 
```

<!-- Issues without reproducible steps will get closed. You can fork https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-test-tiny repo, set up a failing test, then tell us the repo/branch to try. -->

Run the following test without GUI:

```js
describe('My First Test', function() {
  it('Visits the Kitchen Sink', function() {
    cy.wait(3000);   // or more to make it finish abnormally (prematurely)
    // low values still produce an error, but tests continue to run
  })
})
```

```
$ npx cypress run
```

If your screen resolution is greater than 1280x720. Otherwise:

```
$ xvfb-run -s '-screen 0 1280x720x24' npx cypress run
```

`electron` bug: [Screen dimensions are off by one pixel in offscreen mode](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/21379).

### Workarounds

```
$ xvfb-run -s '-screen 0 1280x800x24' npx cypress run
```

Add `.outputOptions(""-vf pad=ceil(iw/2)*2:ceil(ih/2)*2"")` after the following [line][1]. Based on the following Stack Overflow [answer][2]. This fixes it for me.

Or probably `.videoFilter('pad=ceil(iw/2)*2:ceil(ih/2)*2')`.

409987585,Cypress restarting during test,"### Current behavior:
When running a specific test in our Jenkins docker container Cypress restarts a specific test as if it the underlying file has been changed. This observation is based solely on the video, and seeing the test restart with different data generation.

The test eventually fails because a request to the API to set the scenario up returns an error - the amount of time that Cypress spends restarting this test is random and has been as high as 20 minutes. Clearly the error from the API is concerning (it's probably a bug) but it does at least force this test to not take an eternity.

Below archive file contains the full log from running Cypress in Jenkins, the video of the specific test that fails and some elements of the test code in a single file to give some context about the specific actions that are taking place.

[cypress-restarting-during-test.zip](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/files/2861965/cypress-restarting-during-test.zip)

### Desired behavior:
I'm expecting the test to complete, either in a pass or fail result. The continual restarting is very surprising and unexpected.

### Steps to reproduce:
I understand that issues without repro steps are harder to justify spending any time on. I'm unsure how to even reproduce this - I cannot trigger this behaviour locally in either Chrome or Electron.

When I write a test in cypress that performs a drag event on a canvas that has drag event listeners attached from d3, test fail. In the cypress UI, the canvas looks blank (it looks as expected if I am not testing events on the canvas ), the click events seem to register but the actions do not occur.  

### Desired behavior:

When I write a test with drag events on a D3 canvas, I expect the app will act the same as if I had manually performed a drag event.

2. Add the test, that uploads a file to input (for simplifying sample I generate a file instead of using fixtures)
```js

407800342,Add a way for custom commands to provide data for Dashboard,"External services, for example, visual diffing services, have 2 components. First is the custom command that takes the screenshot, sends the image to the external API, receives the result and continues.

For example, the test might have something like this

```js
it('looks the same', () => {
  cy.visit('/')
  cy.imageDiff('home page')
})
```

Second is the external diffing service dashboard that can show the image comparison. User has access to the 3rd party dashboard and would find the results for the above particular `cy.imageDiff()` call at some url like

```
https://app.image-diff-service.com/projects/abc123/e51d4263-1cf1-4d9c-8805-bd5fb311087f
```

If the test run is being recorded on the Cypress Dashboard, it would be nice to have this information and the right link to the external dashboard shown somehow.  For example, in addition to our own screenshots and video and terminal log, we could have a section with external links generated by the custom commands. Maybe somewhere here?

We can provide minimal information about each custom command

- external service name
- command parameters, like ""home page"" in the example
- success/failure status
- link to the external dashboard that should open at the relevant url

## Questions

- What information should we accept from the custom command?
- Should external services register with Cypress.io? How do we ensure that spam links to do start appearing in the Cypress Dashboard?
- Should we show the list of logical commands? And allow meta information on every command?
- Should we tie custom commands with this extra information to the timeline so we can add it to the video?",enhancement

406628320,Inconsistent beforeEach behavior when 'Run all specs' executed.,"### Current behavior:

As one of `cycpress-cucumber-preprocessor` plugin users found out:
https://github.com/TheBrainFamily/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor/issues/139

the `beforeEach` defined in one file runs for every test. 

Having one file:

```javascript
beforeEach(() => {
  cy.log(""This should run only before the first one"");
});

describe(""abcd"", () => {
  it(""dfsdfs"", () => {});
});
```

and another:

```javascript
beforeEach(() => {
  cy.log(""This should run only before the second one"");
});

describe(""abc"", () => {
  it(""dfsdf"", () => {});
});
```

I would expect them to stick to their unique `beforeEach`es, and that's how it works when running them separately, and when running them together using `cypress run`. With `cypress open` and the ""run all specs"" function - they both run both `beforeEach`es.


### Desired behavior:
Consistency between runing specs separately and all together.

### Steps to reproduce: (app code and test code)

406418989,cy.type does not fire events for modifier keys,"Currently, using a modifier key (ctrl, shift, etc) with `cy.type` only sets the property on subsequent type/click events. For example, `cy.get('body').type('{ctrl}a')` will only fire keyup/keydown/events for the `a` with `ctrlKey: true`. 

It should also fire those events for the control key itself. This means `cy.get('body').type('{ctrl}')` essentially does nothing.

We should fire the appropriate events, so the events fired for `{ctrl}a` look something like:

```
keydown ctrl
keydown a
keyup a
keyup ctrl

405297849,Proposal: Add messaging capability between app code and Cypress,"This would allow the user to insert seems into their app code to aid with testing. 

For example, currently in the desktop-gui, we do [this in the code](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/develop/packages/desktop-gui/src/main.jsx#L20):

```javascript
window.App = {
  ipc,

  start () {
    render(<App />, document.getElementById('app'))
  },
}
```

and [this in the test](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/develop/packages/desktop-gui/cypress/integration/app_spec.coffee#L3):

```coffee
beforeEach ->
  cy.visitIndex().then (@win) ->
    { @start, @ipc } = @win.App

    cy.stub(@ipc, ""getOptions"").resolves({})

## later
it ""some test"", ->
  @start()
```

This is mainly so we can delay starting the app, which will automatically run some `ipc` calls before we can stub them. 

With the proposed API, this would look something like this in the code:

```javascript
const renderApp = () => {
  render(<App />, document.getElementById('app'))
}

if (window.cy) {
  window.cy.send('ready', { ipc }, renderApp)
} else {
  renderApp()
}
```

and this in the test:

```coffee
## option 1: with current API of cy.on:
beforeEach (done) ->
  cy.on ""app:message"", ""ready"", ({ ipc }, callback) =>
    cy.stub(ipc, ""getOptions"").resolves({})

    @start = callback
    done()

## option 2: with proposed listenFor/wait API:
beforeEach
  cy.listenFor(""app:message"", ""ready"").as(""ready"")
  cy.visitIndex() 
  cy.wait(""@ready"").then ({ ipc }, callback) =>
    cy.stub(ipc, ""getOptions"").resolves({})

403215188,Feature request: test sections,"When I first started writing tests, I originally organized them like unit tests. This meant each test was small and contained, and only tested one simple thing.
I've learned that it's better to have larger tests that test an entire feature, since this speeds up test execution and reduces duplicated actions.
However, I still want to be able to ""group"" actions within a test, so I know what part of the test is running when I'm looking at the test log.
I've been using `cy.log` for this.  For example, here's a original test spec before I started grouping them together:

```
context('parameters', () => {
  it('allows the user to add a parameter');
  it('allows the user to delete a parameter');
  it('allows the user to rename a parameter');
});
```

And here's what I'm doing now:

```
it('allows the user to edit parameters', () => {
  cy.log('*** add parameter ***');
  cy.log('*** delete parameter ***');
  cy.log('*** rename parameter ***');
});

This works fine, but the `cy.log` statements get lost in the noise and are hard to pick out.

401713478,GitLab CI fails on cy.visit(),"### Current behavior:

On opening tests in GitLab's CI, Cypress will fail the `beforeAll()` hook on its `cy.visit()`-command with a 404 error. This only seems to happen if the visit-url isn't `/`. For example this will work fine and will properly navigate to `/`:

```js
beforeEach(() => {
  // I work
  cy.visit('/');
});
```

But this example crashes with a 404 error despite `/queues` being a valid URL. When `/` and `/queues` are put together in the same `beforeEach()`, the `cy.visit('/')`-command will properly go to the root, but the subsequent navigation to `/queues` will also still fail with a 404 error.

```js
beforeEach(() => {
  // I'll fail with a HTTP/404 error
  cy.visit('/queues');
});
```

However first navigating to `/` with `cy.visit()` and then using the UI to navigate to `/queues` by using `cy.click()` *does* work. But this is for obvious reasons an undesired workaround.

```js
beforeEach(() => {
  // I'm a workaround and I work too
  cy.visit('/');
  cy.get('#menu-queues').click({ force: true }); // Links to /queues
});

Cypress is able to go to the page and does not fail regardless of it being the root or not and without navigation to the root and then click to navigate to the desired page.

400435267,"cy.request(...) fails if server is not available, with no option to return or catch the connection error","### Current behavior

When you use `cy.request(...)` to connect to a server that isn't running, it throws a `CypressError` that is not possible to catch or otherwise handle gracefully:

```
CypressError: cy.request() failed trying to load:

http://localhost:5338/percy/healthcheck

We attempted to make an http request to this URL but the request failed without a response.

We received this error at the network level:

  > Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5338
```

### Desired behavior

I would expect that something similar to `failOnStatusCode: false` exists to allow me to handle the ""connection refused"" case in the same way as I can handle a, say, 404 code.

An alternative could be a `catch` method to be chained off of `cy.request(...)`.

### Context

I'm adding new functionality to the Percy Cypress plugin, which is implemented as a custom Cypress command (https://github.com/percy/percy-cypress). I need to do a check to see if the local percy agent service is running, before proceeding with any more work. Our users typically want to be able to run their test suite with or without ""Percy mode"", so when the local percy service is not running, we'd like to issue a warning but otherwise allow tests to proceed normally.

Because I want to avoid CSP or other security issues in the browser, I want to use `cy.request(...)` or some other capability that allows me to do HTTP requests from outside of the browser context.

If I was doing this for my own test suite, I could use a new `cy.task(...)` to implement this healthcheck, but in the context of a Cypress plugin, that would require users to do additional setup in their `plugins/index.js`, in addition to what they already have to do in `support/commands.js`.

An alternate solution to this problem would be exposing an API in Cypress that allows me to programmatically add a `cy.task(...)` that I can then use in my custom command.

Another alternative would be a hook to catch this `CypressError` within a command, and the ability to inspect it and re-throw it if appropriate.",enhancement
399844388,Attachment path injected into the test object is not passed to the reporter,"### Current behavior:
New feature in **mocha-junit-reporter** allows for an attachment path to be included in the report output file. To achieve this the attachment path is injected into the test object:
```js
it ('should include attachment', function () {
  this.test.attachments = ['/absolut/path/to/file.png'];
});
```
(as described here: https://github.com/michaelleeallen/mocha-junit-reporter#attachments)

Currently Cypress does not pass the injected _attachment_ in the test object passed to the reporter:
```json
{
  ""title"": ""should include attachment"",
  ""pending"": false,
  ""type"": ""test"",
  ""body"": ""function () {\n  this.test.attachments = ['/absolut/path/to/file.png'];\n}"",

399527312,cy.fixture('foo.json') as text instead of object,"### Current behavior:

I have a fixture file that contains JSON data to be sent to the server to put the back-end in a specific state. It is sent as JSON text.
When using `cy.fixture()` or `cy.readFile()`, someone's parsing that JSON text and handing me an object.
Normally this is good, but in my case since I am just going to turn around and send the JSON text to the server, it seems like an unnecessary step to have to call `JSON.stringify`; why can't cypress just hand me the raw text?

### Desired behavior:

Add some option to `cy.fixture` that lets me force it to be text, even if the file extension is `.json`.

397623661,Proposal: Launch single cypress test from vscode,"It would be awesome to be able to run a single cypress test in the cypress devtool directly from vscode. Currently something like that exists for debugging a jest test:

As seen in the above photo, a user can hit ""debug"" and launch a debugging session for an individual jest test. I think it would be super awesome if I could press a ""run cypress"" button from the editor and have the devtool launch just that test. 

In order to get that feature to work I think a few things would need to be done: 

 - programmatic launching of a single test file using the `cypress open` command (not currently available according to https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line.html#cypress-open). This would look like `cypress open mySpec.js`


 - programmatic running of just 1 test within a file (NOTE: **Not Essential** as this can already be done using it.only and is potentially a complicated issue, see https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/925)

 - actually making the cypress vscode plugin to put it all together!

It now contains:
```javascript
{
  absolute: ""__all"",

}
```

I use `Cypress.spec` in my [cypress-plugin-snapshots](https://github.com/meinaart/cypress-plugin-snapshots) plugin to determine snapshot filename. I found a very hard work around by using a preprocessor to store the latest processed file. But this breaks other stuff. It would be very useful if `Cypress.spec` would contain the actual current test.

396768424,Add response alias support (res.alias),"<!-- Is this a question? Don't open an issue. Ask in our chat https://gitter.im/cypress-io/cypress-->

### Current behavior:

It's a bit error prone to wait for specific GraphQL queries, if they run simultaneously or their order of execution is unknown or the response times cause race conditions, as they all run on the same endpoint, for example `/graphql`.

My current workaraound is a recursive function: 

```js
export function waitForResponseFromGraphQLServer(query) {
  return cy
    .wait(""@graphqlResponse"")
    .then(r => Cypress._.get(r, 'response.body'))
    .then(xhr => Cypress.Blob.blobToBinaryString(xhr))
    .then(respString => JSON.parse(respString).data)
    .then(response => {
      if (response[query]) {
       // response did match the  query to be waited for?
        return cy.wrap(response[query]);
      }
     // response was for some other query -> recursive invokation
      return waitForResponseFromGraphQLServer(query);
    });
}
```

This works _often_, but suffers from some flakyness, which could also be caused by https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2700. Also i'm not 100% sure how this recursion works with Cypress.

### Desired behavior:

A solution to define already on the route, _the content_ i'm waiting for, and keep waiting until i have found the specified content or the timeout is reached. This could be achieved with a validation callback option with the signature `xhrResponse => Promise<boolean> | boolean`. For example:

```js
cy.route({
  method: 'DELETE',
  url: '**/user/*',
  waitForContent: xhr => isResponseForGraphQLQuery(xhr, query)

394612948,Make loop ,"Hi all,

Quite new to Cypress... Started using it to get some PDF files from an external website.

What i want / do right now
- using BeforeEach for visiting website
- logon to website once using password and Captcha (this works, where a add 10 seconds waiting time to give the right captcha-code.

- then a lot of code for downloading the PDF's. 

Works all great, but want a loop after logging in the website (not chaptcha for every loop). I need those PDF's for different customercodes (from a CSV) . Testmode of the website is not available.

Is this possible? How to fix this if a loop (each ....) without logging in again?
Possible in 1 script? Or maybe the solution can be found in 2 test scripts ?(1 login and then start a second testscript with loop??)

Thanks in advance.

393935336,onkeydown is inaccessible from cy.window(),"Hi,

I've set `window.onkeydown` in my web page.

I am in a cypress test and want to access and run it (because `cy.type()` does not simulate a key down event in this way).

I call `cy.window.then((w) => w.onkeydown({key: ""c""}) ) `

Upon some brief investigation, it turns out that:

- `w.onkeydown` is `null`
- When I run `console.log(w)` it shows that `w.onkeydown` is not `null`, and in fact is the function I am expecting it to be, according to the `[[FunctionLocation]]` metadata.

So the function I want to invoke is accessible from where I am, but is not being mapped over to the actual returned value of `cy.window()` I suppose.

Hope this helps,

392578350,Requery aliased DOM elements,"### Current behavior:

An alias onto a DOM selection is a snapshot. So `cy.get('@listElements').should('have.length', 2)` will yield the same result at any point in the test even if list elements are added or removed. 

This makes aliases difficult to use in some cases.

### Desired behavior:

An alias can be overwritten easily though. So you could write a command that overwrites a specific alias and use that instead of `get` (see `updatelistElements` command). But this breaks the readability and flow of the test a bit.

The `get` command does have all the information it would need to update the alias. The yield contains the `prevObject` property that can be traversed so that together with the `selector` property the alias can be updated.
This is illustrated in the `updateAlias` command that wraps a `cy.get` but updates the alias at the same time.

People could simply use the `updateAlias` command but it might also be nice to have this functionality in a different way.
Maybe a live alias could be created like so: `cy.get('li').as('listElements', {live: true})` that would always update the alias on a `get` command.
Or maybe the get could be use like this: `cy.get('@listElements', {update: true})`.

390638119,Group tests to improve performance by reducing the amount of page loads,"### Current behavior:
When you want to improve runtime by reducing page loads you have to order your tests by their run order, even if that doesn't make sense from a logical standpoint.

I want to use Cypress to test a single page application that's different based on the parameters with which it's loaded. In this case, the parameters are `userId` and `authorization`. The application can get pretty complex so I order my test files by the part of the application they are testing. In some cases, properly testing the part of the application under test requires reloading the application with different parameters.

That also means that in my current implementation I'm reloading the page 50+ times, about 35 of which are the exact same page with the same `userId` and `authorization`. That's pretty wasteful.

### Desired behavior:
I want to be able to specify groups of tests across files that run with a single shared `before` script. That would allow me to set up the page in the `before` script and run my tests on that one instance of the application, greatly reducing the number of repeated steps required for running the suite.

Thinking I could control the Mocha instance of Cypress I [wrote a Mocha UI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha-bundle-ui) to solve this problem. This package accurately describes the desired behaviour for me.

I've been asking about a way to accomplish this on Gitter but I didn't get a response, that probably means there is no way to do this yet.

### Steps to reproduce: (app code and test code)

<!-- Issues without reproducible steps will get closed. You can fork https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-test-tiny repo, set up a failing test, then tell us the repo/branch to try. -->
This is my code:
```js
describe('Testing the hover function over the plus sign', () => {
    it('hover over the plus sign', () => {
        cy.visit('https://www.themoviedb.org/')
        cy.get('.right > .primary > :nth-child(1) > .glyph_wrapper > .glyph > .glyphicons').trigger('mouseover').contains('Can\'t find a movie or TV show? Login to create it.')

    })

389272448,can't click on some rotated buttons,"<!-- Is this a question? Don't open an issue. Ask in our chat https://gitter.im/cypress-io/cypress-->

### Current behavior:
I have two buttons, basically the exact same, one rotated with `transform: rotate(90deg);` and one `-90deg`. Cypress can't click on the one with `-90deg` rotation, showing:
```
CypressError: Timed out retrying: cy.click() failed because the center of this element is hidden from view:

<button tabindex=""0"" class=""MuiButtonBase-root-74 MuiIconButton-root-68"" type=""button"" data-testid=""test-SettingsDialog/4/Handler 1/down"" style=""transform: rotate(-90deg);"">...</button>
```

The problem seems to be that the scrolling to this button is not working. `.scrollIntoView()` is not working as well. It is always off by some small constant amount. If the viewport is big enough that no scrolling is possible it also works to click both buttons.

I also tried recreating this with two buttons only and it works there. So seems to be related to some parents/their styles.

389150180,Change baseUrl during test (set to null) in order to visit local file instead of URL,"<!-- Is this a question? Don't open an issue. Ask in our chat https://gitter.im/cypress-io/cypress-->

### Current behavior:
We are currently implementing email confirmation test. 
We currently download the email file -> parse out the html content of it -> save it locally in fixture/. 

In order for `cypress.visit('path-to-local-file.html')` to load up the downloaded content, we need to change the `baseUrl` that was set in `cypress.json` to be empty. 

`Cypress.config('baseUrl', ' `');` doesn't switch `baseUrl` and keeps appending the path to local file to the original `baseUrl`, eg:  https://demo.test.com/fixtures/email-content.html

Also tried to follow https://docs.cypress.io/api/plugins/configuration-api.html#Usage but it also fails to switch out `baseUrl`. 

I couldn't find any workaround. 

One method I tried was NOT setting `baseUrl` in `cypress.json` and specify the main domain everywhere except for visiting local html file. But this also fails because we have a `before` hook that generates unique string for email and if you change the domain on `cy.visit()`, the `before` hook runs and the email file name won't match.

### Desired behavior:

`Cypress.config('baseUrl', ' ');` should switch baseUrl to none. 

### Steps to reproduce: (app code and test code)

Posting it as pseudo-code. Will fill in more details if needed.

**cypress.json**
```json
{
    ""baseUrl"": ""https://demo.testing.com"",
    ""userAgent"": ""testing""

 var emailFileName;

    before(function () {
        cy.log('ran');
        cy.task('generateGuid').then(function ($guid) {
            guid = $guid;
            emailFileName = 'tester' + guid + '@test.com';
            cy.log(emailText);
        });
    });

it('Register user', function () {

        cy.visit('/login'); //-> yields https://demo.testing.com/login
        // Fill up registration info then click 'Register' button

        cy.wait(5000);
        cy.get(sendConfirmEmailButton).click({ force: true });

        // wait for 30s to verify email body
        cy.wait(20000);
        cy.downloadEmailHtml(emailFileName, 'confirmAccount');
    });

it('Visit email user', function () {
        // Change baseurl
        Cypress.config('baseUrl', ' ');
        // TODO visit/load the confirm account html file
        cy.visit(`cypress/fixtures/confirmAccount_${emailFileName}@test.com.html`);
        cy.get('#templateBody')
            .contains('Click the button below to confirm your account');

388361902,Allow for random spec ordering when running tests,"### Current behavior:

When running specs in cypress, the files run in alphabetical order, and tests within each spec run in order. See #2901.

### Desired behavior:

It'd be great to pass a flag into cypress (or for it to do some sort of optimization like Jest does) to randomize the order of test runs. This would allow tests that rely on other state to fail and could help increase confidence in how the app works.

",question
387652838,Is the test order within one file (one describe block) guaranteed?,"So this may not even be a Cypress specific thing but since I'm using Cypress I still think it's bes to ask here.

I'ts a very simply question:

_Is the test order within one file (one describe block) guaranteed?_

Why do I ask that?

We have quite a lot of database dependent tests.
Because of this we often have to seed our database data within tests.

Now let's assume I have the following tests:

```js
describe('My database tests', () => {
  // this is only done once for all tests in this block
  before(() => {
    seedUsersInDatabase();
  });

  it('Get users', () => {
    // expect 10 users
   });

  it('Remove users', () => {
    // expect 5 users removed
   });
});
```
Maybe you already see why the question poppep up.

If it's guaranteed that the tests within a `describe` block are always executed in the same order, I can seed the database with `before`. However if the order is not guaranteed I'd need to change it to `beforeEach`.

I personally assumed the order is guaranteed and therefore wrote only the `before`. The main reason for this is by the way: _Performance_! Seeding a database sometimes takes quite the time (even if it's just 100ms, it sums up if you have a lot of tests).",question

386998832,"Cypress logs timeout, fails test, but keeps running all commands. no way to know why it is timeing out. ","### Current behavior:

Cypress ""randomly"" is logging a Timeout failure but is not linking it to anything specific. These commands typically coincide with my custom commands, which are not timeouting before the specified timeout in other projects and when they do, it throws the appropriate message. 

I've already ruled out the custom command as an issue because it works as expected in other projects. Rather, I want to **debug cypress** but finding it to be **impossible** given the current lack of information provided by the runner.

This is the end of the tests (All my commands and assertions ran correctly)

I'm curious as to why a `document.execCommand(""copy"")` fails when being run during a cypress test (as a side effect to a `cy.get().click()` ). Curiously it works fine once I'm manually clicking the same element after the test has run. 

The failing test in question can be reproduced by running the following code: 
```js
describe(""menuBar"", function() {
  beforeEach(() => {
    cy.visit(""http://teselagen.github.io/openVectorEditor/#/Editor"");
  });
  
  it(""select range, copy, cut works"", function() {

    cy.contains(""Selection Cut"")
    cy.get("".veStatusBar"").contains(`5288`)

});
```

If you run the above example, the test will fail to find ""Selection Copied"". This is because 
```js
const worked = document.execCommand(type);
```
evaluates to `false` so the ""Selection Copied"" popover is not shown. 

You can add a breakpoint manually to the `commands/index.js` file and see it not working.

Strangely, after the test has run if you manually click ""File > Edit > Copy"" then the `document.execCommand(""copy"")` works just fine. Not sure what is going on here to stop it from working when cypress is running its tests.

384805399,Sorry that asking the question here. But i need you help guys. Cypress conditional testing,"Sorry that asking the question here, but here I do not answer https://gitter.im/cypress-io/cypress. I have a week sitting on this problem and I'm desperate. Please help me save my job :(


I have text that appears in a certain scenario. If the user exists. Then I get a message about it. If such a user does not exist. That message is not displayed and the user is created. How do I handle the 2 scenarios. To cypress did not give an error. I mean. How can I check the presence of an element on the page and if it is, then do A, and if this element is not, then do B

I read about conditional testing in the documentation and i try use ""then"" Command but i cant understand how it work. I am not developer. I am QA and my knowledge about programming is bad.

How can I even check if there is an item on the page. And if there is none. cypress won't give me a mistake. And let's just say that ""no Element on the page.

383844041,Expose jQuery.expr and potentially other jQuery attributes & methods on Cypress.$,"While working on extending Cypress and hammer it to our needs (via custom commands, plugins, etc), I got stuck as I wanted to add a custom matcher to jQuery (via jQuery.expr - example here https://stackoverflow.com/a/18462522).

382017032,File watch is not reliable when using 'safe write' in IDE.,"### Current behavior:

When file changes are ""safely"" saved by copying to a temp file, deleting the original, and then renaming the temp file, Cypress watch does not reliably detect the file change.

I noticed this issue because the *default* behavior in my IDE, WebStorm, is to use ""safe write"". This option is checked by default: Appearance & Behavior -> System Settings -> Use ""safe write"" (save changes to a temporary file first)
WebStorm setting description: ""If this check box is selected, a changed file will be first saved to a temporary file; if the save operation is completed successfully, the original file is deleted, and the temporary file is renamed.""

### Desired behavior:

Cypress should detect that files have been replaced and inspect for changes -- the way most other editors are able to do, like Notepad++.

### Steps to reproduce:

1. Start up cypress and watch for any spec file in Windows.
2. Delete the spec file and replace it with a copy with some changes.
3. Observe that Cypress does not reliably detect the change. (sometimes it does, which is weird)
4. Observe that clicking ""Run all tests"" again in the browser does not re-read the file.

Operating system: Windows 10
Browser: Chrome 70

The DOM Snapshot preview can get into a state where it remains in preview mode - regardless of where the mouse is currently hovering, clicking or doing.

![](http://g.recordit.co/4ZrHYAuqgq.gif)

### Desired behavior:

The DOM Snapshot should not get stuck.

### Steps to reproduce:

When hovering over a command in the Command Log, the DOM Snapshot of the command previews. In this case - and the only case I've replicated it - it is a 'before/after' Snapshot for `,type()`. 

Leaving the mouse hovering over the command, `cmd` + `tab` over to the text editor and edit the current test so that the running test refreshes - the DOM Snapshot preview will remain in preview mode - so that the only way to remove this state is to close Cypress and reopen.

```js

Why? Because apparently accessing `window[0]` now returns the cross origin `window`. I can't find where in the spec it defines this behavior, and perhaps this is a recent change to chrome? 

At any rate, this is happening because we have some naive internal checks to determine whether a value is an element, the document, or the window.

Right now, whenever you start Cypress it will kick off some of the commands twice.

If the commands are inverted (i.e., if you visit() before logging) then the results are fine, so maybe Cypress waits for visit then reboots?

### Current behavior:
<!-- images, stack traces, etc -->
The [`.clear()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/clear.html#Syntax) command is an alias for `.type({selectall}{backspace})`. However, typing in date fields is limited to strings matching the date format. This causes Cypress to throw an error.

Currently, during CI, the client-side connects to local server-side and this makes all API calls very fast. But in production, users are not so close to the server and I would prefer if I could test a more realistic scenario where there is a bandwidth and latency limits.

In Chrome, in web development tool, you can configure the speed and latency override for all HTTP requests. I think it would be great if one could control this from tests in Cypress (or for all tests, or just for some).

### Current behavior:

Calling `cy.setCookie` multiple times always sets the same cookie as the first call if you pass the same options object each time. For example, the following sets two cookies named ""foo"" and ""baz"". 

```js
'use strict';
  
Cypress.Cookies.debug(true);

const options = {};

describe('cookie reuse', function() {
    it('sets the expected cookie', function() {
        cy.setCookie('foo', 'bar', options);

        cy.getCookie('baz').its('value').should('equal', 'qux');
        cy.getCookie('apple').its('value').should('equal', 'banana');
    });
});
```

The Cypress log shows the names and values of all three cookies I tried to create, but the console shows that only two cookies were created:

![setcookie-always-sets-same-cookie-when-options-object-is-the-same](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/142725/47822129-031a6e80-dd31-11e8-81e3-d2dec60317ad.png)

The cookies section in the Chrome dev tools also shows only two cookies, ""foo"" and ""baz"":

![setcookie-cookies-list](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/142725/47822243-6e644080-dd31-11e8-94f6-621fef8e0301.png)

The ""apple"" cookie was never created. The call to `cy.setCookie('apple', 'banana', options);` just set the ""foo"" cookie again.

### Desired behavior:

If I call `cy.setCookie` twice with different cookie names and values, but use the same options object in both calls, I expect to create two separate cookies.

376151936,cy.request + Callback Queue Race Conditions prevent LocalStorage from being cleared prior to each `it`,"### Current behavior:

When i have a complex set of conditions (100% reproduced in the Test repository below 👇 ), `localStorage` is not cleared prior to each `it` (we do a `cy.visit` in `beforeEach`)

One weird condition - `cy.request` MUST be called before `visit` and it MUST take some time to respond (I've found as little as 1s can cause failures, but in this example i set my mock api to 2s)

Another weird condition - the **application code** has to be updating the `localStorage` in a weird way. In my example, I use redux with redux-localstorage and a `setTimeout` which increases on each iteration.

We assert localStorage item `redux_test` is null and it fails:

<!-- images, stack traces, etc -->

it is 100% reproducible. 

### Desired behavior:

If we take out the `cy.request` in the `beforeEach`, every time `it` is run, the `localStorage` is cleared correctly even with all the wacky `setTimeout` redux stuff done in app code (no other app code changes)

Desired behaviour is, Even when doing `cy.request` in beforeEach, the output should be all passing:

374970567,Automatically accept geolocation permission / mock geolocation for tests,"### Current behavior:
I have a map and a button in my app. When user clicks the button it identifies it’s current position and map pin moves to the current location of the user. This does not happen when running cypress tests.

370681999,Fix Cypress's script injection for certain HTML pages,"### Current behavior:

Cypress automatically injects scripts into all HTML pages. These scripts exist to e.g. set `document.domain` to prevent iframes from becoming cross-origin.

It would be helpful to be able to disable this for certain URLs. These scripts can cause problems in several ways:
 - The script is injected before `<!DOCTYPE>`, which prevents the doctype node from taking effect. (`document.doctype` is null.) We need to be able to set the doctype reliably, alas.
 - The script's presence alters the structure of the DOM, which breaks code that depends on a certain structure. (That's unfortunately unavoidable for our app.)
- Setting `document.domain` throws in a sandboxed iframe.

### Desired behavior:

Ideally there'd be a way to disable this via e.g. `cy.route()` or `cy.server()`. We currently have to work around this in our app itself in a pretty brittle way.

### Summary of this thread so far
`cy.clearLocalStorage` doesn't behave the way I assumed it would. It doesn't clear _all_ local storage. The docs have since been updated to reflect this.

---

### Current behavior:

I was trying to write a simple test for some to do list website when I noticed that certain state wasn't being cleared correctly between tests. So I added some sanity checks like `cy.clearCookies()` and `cy.clearLocalStorage()` - which in theory should be redundant - and then I observed this: https://youtu.be/x6Yeh6WM5fM

Oddly enough, it looks like local state is magically reappearing for reasons I don't understand. Any idea what's going on? Here's the code snippet I executed:

```javascript
describe('Hello world', () => {
    before(function () {
        cy.viewport(1200, 660)
        cy.clearCookies()
        cy.clearLocalStorage()
        cy.wait(20000)
        cy.visit('https://www.any.do/').contains('Login').click()
        cy.contains('ALREADY A MEMBER?', {
            'timeout': 10000
        }).click()
        cy.get('#emailSignin #email').type('spam@pieterdedecker.be')
        cy.get('#emailSignin #password').type('badpassword')
        cy.contains('SIGN IN').click()
    })

    it('Is a test', () => {
        cy.log('Look!')
    })
})
```

Even going into the developer tools, Application tab, clicking 'Clear storage' and then clearing everything doesn't reset it. The only workaround I have found is selecting the local storage data for https://web.any.do and clicking 'Clear All'.

### Desired behavior:

The old local storage data should not reappear when the test reaches the domain https://web.any.do.

### Steps to reproduce:

1. Run this script with valid credentials. I've changed my example account's password, but you can use anydo@mailinator.com with password 'anydone'. The script should work even without the `cy.wait`; that was just to give me time to inspect cookie/local storage beforehand.
2. The test will pass.
3. Rerun the test.
4. The test will fail because it suddenly remembers the login.

Is there an option to add environment to the dashboard UI?
So for example if we run sanity tests (or any e2e) for the same project on different environments we have no way to know where did the test ran.

When the dashboard went down yesterday all our cypress runs failed with the error below, which meant we were unable to ship code until the job was reconfigured to run tests serially.

```
14:00:40 cypress-e2e_1  | We encountered an unexpected error talking to our servers.
14:00:40 cypress-e2e_1  | 
14:00:40 cypress-e2e_1  | Because you passed the --parallel flag, this run cannot proceed because it requires a valid response from our servers.

14:00:40 cypress-e2e_1  |

```

### Desired behavior:

Cypress should ping the dashboard and if it is unavailable, run tests serially instead of just bombing (remove the `--parallel`, `--record`, `--key`, and `ci-build-id` flags.  Slow tests are better than broken tests.

### Steps to reproduce:

1) Kill dashboard
2) Run tests that communicate with dashboard

### Current behavior:

Currently, it's only possible to switch the video feature on or off in a binary way.

<!-- images, stack traces, etc -->

### Desired behavior:

To be able to record and process videos only when a test fails. If there's no way to do this (due to the recording feature not knowing whether a test will fail or not when it begins to record) - the processing part could at least be tweaked so that only failed tests have their videos processed and saved, whereas passing tests are technically recorded, but never processed or saved to disk if the test passes.

When I `cy.get('...').click();` no `mousemove` events are triggered, so every mousemove related scripts are broken.

### Desired behavior:

We would like to be able to link the company email addresses to Cypress with user accounts independent from GitHub for several reasons:

- Private email accounts generally shouldn't be exposed to the company.
- Currently someone with access to a private email account of one of our employees could get access to the Cypress dashboard of our company, which is a security issue as we don't have any control over private email accounts.
- Employees who leave the company still have access to the Cypress dashboard until we revoke access manually.

362278952,API latency issue causes tests fail,"Not sure if cypress has the feature or not.

I am writing an integration test right now. And the tests use `post` API call in `before()` function. The API call is used to create a person. In test, I will use the person created in `before()` function. However, I can't search out this person sometimes because of API latency. In other words, the person's name is not in searching result page. Before using cypress, I was using a while loop and checked whether the searching page had the name. If not, it reloaded the page in the while loop until it found the name. But I don't think I can do it in cypress. I tried to use `cy.get('table').should($t => {do something(like reload) })`, but it didn't work since `$t` won't change after reload so I am stuck for this problem. 

The current solution for me is to `cy.wait(30000)` before searching the name. However, it still fails sometimes.  Is there anything suggestion to this issue? Thank you.",question
361931278,Alias for future elements,"I'm a front-end developer and just getting started with Cypress. Perhaps my technique is not correct, but I'm finding that use of aliases makes my tests much easier to read.

I'd love to put all my aliases at the top of the test, then use them as needed. But if I create an alias for an element that doesn't exist yet, an error will be generated when the alias is created.

I'm experimenting with different ways around this, including splitting tests and using long timeouts. I understand why this happens, but it would be nice if there was a flag for `cy.get` or an alternative method that could be used to store a complex selector for future use.

### Current behaviour:

```
cy.get('.some-element-that-doesn't-exist-yet > .with ~ .a-really [name=""complex""] + .selector').as('element');
...
// element is created as a result of interactions
...
cy.get(@element).should('have.class', 'supported'); // cy error

cy.get('.some-element-that-doesn't-exist-yet > .with ~ .a-really [name=""complex""] + .selector').as('element');

361706990,Mock websockets,"### Current behavior:
We can use `cy.server()` and `cy.route(...)` to mock HTTP calls.

### Desired behavior:
The exact same thing for Websockets.

For apps using websockets quite heavily this would come really handy.

Might be related to [https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/199](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/199)

Would be great to have the ability to watch a bi-directional web socket to process messages from the back-end as they are received.

Use Case:

User preforms a action through the front-end which actions several back-end events.  It would be great if we could monitor that these different events did occur (there is an endless amount of different events and combinations of events).

What would be great if there was a simple message pool/queue or a way to ""monitor"" a bi-direcitonal websocket and capturing the messages received from the back-end.

We would then write tests to check if those events are being executed by looking at the socket/pool/queue and seeing if the events were received after X user actions.

2. Then I successfully added a [wallaby.conf.js](https://wallabyjs.com/) file. (fwiw: I used the clean create-react-app config file shown at https://wallabyjs.com/docs/integration/react-jsx.html#create-react-app .)  Everything was going as expected at this point.
3. Then I ran:
```
npm install cypress --save-dev 
```

### Current behavior:

I got the following output, but **_most importantly it deleted my `react-scripts` directory!_** (If you don't know, this is kind of a *_critical_* package for a create-react-app.)

Why would Cypress remove 1115 packages, on a project not even 15 minutes old — that many packages certainly weren't outdated yet, and they weren't packages that it had previously installed.

### Desired behavior:

Not to delete `react-scripts` from `node_modules`.

# Follow-up Info

To get back to my pre-cypress state, I ended up having to do:
1. `git reset --hard HEAD`
2. delete my `node_modules` directory
3. `npm install` again

I guess I'm a gluten, because I then decided to try install Cypress again.  

This second time went as originally expected, with the following output (notice that it is distinctly different than the previous time I ran it):

```
> cypress@3.1.0 postinstall /Users/me/lerna-app/packages/app/node_modules/cypress
> node index.js --exec install

I have no idea what the difference was between the two installs. 🤷‍♂️

358277821,"Allow cy.wait command to accept ""requestTimeout"" and ""responseTimeout"" option.","### Current behavior:

The `cy.wait` command does not respect the ""requestTimeout"" option. The following command will still timeout waiting for a request to begin after 5000ms:
```js
cy.wait('@completeUpload', {requestTimeout: 20000})
```

### Desired behavior:

The following command should wait up to `20000ms` for a request to start before timing out.
```js
cy.wait('@completeUpload', {requestTimeout: 20000})

OS: macOS 10.13.6
Browser: Chrome 68

357251415,[Question] What's the best/recommended way to handle login before each test with setting (Redux) state,"Hi all!

At my company we're making a SaaS app in React + Redux, which is only available for logged in users (like most SaaS apps).

Of course I've already read [the recommendations about logging in](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/testing-your-app.html#Logging-In).
The only problem we face, is that we're setting (Redux) state after the request happened, so the proposed `cy.request()` won't help.

Is there any recommendation for stuff like this?

We tried executing our custom `cy.login()` command inside the `test:before:run` event hook (which does a manual login, but will only run once due to the hook), but we couldn't get this to work unfortunately. 😕

Hopefully somebody can help us with  this. 🙂

Thanks in advance for putting your time into our question! 🙂

Kind regards,

### Current behavior:

After ```cy.screenshot```, an infinite sequence of errors is thrown due to corrupt timers.
<!-- images, stack traces, etc -->

### Desired behavior:

Timers don't become corrupted.

<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen -->

### Steps to reproduce:

Sorry I don't have a small failing example. The app code looks like this:

```js
Rx.Observable.of(true)
    .concat(Rx.Observable.fromEvent(window, 'resize'))
    .debounceTime(200).subscribe(() =>
        callback(['viewportWidth', document.documentElement.clientWidth]));
```

which allows the app to adjust layout after a screen resize. From poking around the ```screenshot``` code, it apparently defers ```setInterval```, ```setTimeout```, and ```requestAnimationFrame``` calls, then resizes the page, screenshots, resizes again, and processes the deferred calls.

I don't know the precise failure mode, but it's the rxjs ```debounceTime``` scheduler that is broken after this call. It will run endlessly, throwing errors due to the action being stale. I suspect the problem is that the cypress timer shims did not consider ```clearInterval``` and friends. So, the debounce mechanism will set an interval, receive a resize event, then receive another resize event, causing it to clear the interval. Clearing the interval does nothing due to the return value from cypress' shimmed method being meaningless (return value of [].push), and then cypress processes its call queue, invoking the original ```setInterval```. So instead of ```setInterval``` followed by ```clearInterval```, it will run ```clearInterval``` on a meaningless value, followed by ```setInterval```. That's just a guess, based on the code & behavior.

I expect I can work around it for now by introducing an out-of-band flag to filter the resize events while screenshotting.

When running Cypress against a site that implements [SRI hashes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity), resources on the page are immediately blocked by Chrome and the page will not load due to invalid hashes. Disabling `chromeWebSecurity` does nothing. The following error appears in the Chrome DevTools console.

### Desired behavior:

The page of an SRI enabled site can load and not be blocked by Chrome. Either Cypress dynamically corrects the hash when it tampers with the file, or the `chromeWebSecurity` option actually disables SRI checks in Chrome.

348332544,Cypress behind corporate proxy with cross-domain static content times out,"This is probably one of the instances of problems caused by cypress behind a corporate proxy (#1469), but I haven't seen a bug report that is similar to this, so let me file it here :-)

### Current behavior:

We are running cypress in a docker container (started from jenkins) behind a corporate proxy. I am passing the proper `http_proxy`, `https_proxy` and `no_proxy` env variables.

As a minimal test case, we are doing:

```js
const logo = '[data-test=""main-logo""]';

describe('basic test', function () {
    it('Connect to test via direct url', function(){
        cy.visit('https://www.bol.com/nl/');
        cy.get(logo).should('be.visible');
    });
});
```

This fails with a timeout, but it does seem able to fetch the HTML (see screenshot)

![basic test -- connect to test via direct url failed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3909851/43779582-04227c0c-9a59-11e8-8e9a-9f999b7b2145.png)

I think the problem comes from the fact that we are serving our static content, including javascript, fonts and css, from a different superdomain (https://s.s-bol.com). In the debug logging of cypress, we see repeats of this:

```
07:24:55 Mon, 06 Aug 2018 05:24:55 GMT cypress:server:server Got CONNECT request from s.s-bol.com:443
07:24:55 Mon, 06 Aug 2018 05:24:55 GMT cypress:https-proxy Writing socket connection headers for URL: s.s-bol.com:443
07:24:55 Mon, 06 Aug 2018 05:24:55 GMT cypress:server:cors Parsed URL { port: '443', tld: 'com', domain: 's-bol' }

07:24:55 Mon, 06 Aug 2018 05:24:55 GMT cypress:https-proxy Making direct connection to s.s-bol.com:443
```

With the direct connection not being passed through our proxy, and eventually timing out. This is supported by the fact that a slightly different test setup where the static content is served from the superdomain do pass. The setup of our proxy seems okay: when I do a `curl` for static content from the same docker container, it passes through (and times out when the proxy-settings are absent)

The basic test succeeds

348228788,Discussion: e2e testing,"We have an ios and android app and we are currently building a progressive web app for it. 

For testing the app we use Detox (https://github.com/wix/detox) for our e2e tests and I’m currently evaluating frameworks for e2e tests for our web app. Cypress looks cool, but I have some issues with the concept. 

In this video https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5XQOK0v_YRE @brian-mann says that tests should run independently. One should thoroughly test the login and then for everything else mock a logged in user. The first definition of e2e test that comes online when searching in google is from techopedia:
https://www.techopedia.com/definition/7035/end-to-end-test

> Definition - What does End-to-End Test mean?
> 
> End-to-end testing is a methodology used to test whether the flow of an application is performing as designed from start to finish. The purpose of carrying out end-to-end tests is to identify system dependencies and to ensure that the right information is passed between various system components and systems.
> Techopedia explains End-to-End Test
> 
> End-to-end testing involves ensuring that the integrated components of an application function as expected. The entire application is tested in a real-world scenario such as communicating with the database, network, hardware and other applications. 
> 
> For example, a simplified end-to-end testing of an email application might involve:
> Logging in to the application
> Accessing the inbox
> Opening and closing the mailbox
> Composing, forwarding or replying to email
> Checking the sent items
> Logging out of the application

The first sentence reads “to test whether the flow of an application is performing as designed from start to finish”. With e2e tests we are talking about a flow, which is different from unit tests where we testing different units in isolation. 

With detox I’m able to simulate the flow of interaction with our app. The user logs in, then he is able to perform different actions one after another. 

After loging in the user creates an article, then he comments on the article etc. The user is not able to comment without first creating an article. There is no point of executing a comment test before creating an article. There is also no point of always logging in the user before each test. Nobody in real life logs in before every action. I understand the reasoning of starting with clear state for each test, but this goes against the way users acutally interact with our applications. There are situations in which the user enters an url directly, but in 99.99% of the time we navigate from page to page by clicking on buttons on the site. The user follows a pattern that the developer has created for him. 

Is it possible for cypress to execute tests one after the other without refreshing the state and without actully starting a new browser instance. I would like to create a suite of tests that need to execute in particular order one after the other.

```javascript
// plugins file
const somePlugin = require('some-plugin')

module.exports = (on) => {
  on('task', {

module.exports = (on) => {
  on('task', {

  })
}

Even though they each registered different task events, the user's task events are overwritten by the plugin. Instead, all the events should be merged together and registered. 

We need to handle event conflicts in some way, in case there is an attempt to register the same task event twice.

346263029,trigger a function after video processing,"I'm running Cypress in a Docker container, and I'm trying to fetch as much infos as possible about the executed test before closing the container.
So I created a plugin that will upload the screenshots & videos to S3 after the execution of the test, this plugin is triggered by the `after` hook.
but I noticed that the uploaded video is the un-processed/un-compressed video.
is there any way to trigger the video upload after the processing is finished ? 
PS: I tried to put a listener on the `exit` event so it can upload the video before closing the application, but it didn't work for me.
this is a preview of the code I wrote:
- the hook:
```js
after(function () {
    cy.task('endMySession', null, {""log"": false, ""timeout"": 180000});
});
```
- the plugin:
```js
module.exports = (on, config) => {
    // `on` is used to hook into various events Cypress emits
    // `config` is the resolved Cypress config

    on('task', {
        'endMySession': (args) => {
            let promises = [];

345834846,Blur active element if cy.type subject is 'body',"**Currently**, if `cy.type`'s subject is `body`, Cypress will not blur the active element, and instead just send key events to the body while ignoring typing any characters and skipping actionability checks

### Current behavior:

cy.contains() yields only the first matched element and there is no config option to allow yielding of all matched elements. Only viable workaround for this is to use the `cy.get(el:contains(foo))` pseudo selector which is potentially deprecated (I couldn't find it mentioned in the current css3 spec) and kind of unknown/hacky. I had to dig to find out it was actually a thing.
 
### Desired behavior:

Add a new `yieldAll` property to the acceptable options config object for cy.contains. It's default state would be `false` and would behave as it currently does only returning first matched element. If set to a value of `true`, it will yield all matched elements, setting them as the subject and behave the same as a cy.get with the :contains pseudo selector currently does.

### Example

```js
 cy
    .get('.link')
    .contains('Sign Up', { yieldAll: true })
    .each(($el) => {
        expect($el).to.have.attr('href', '/sign_up');

342367199,Monorepo with multiple apps usage - allow passing of `projects` array to `cypress run`,"Say I have a monorepo with multiple apps which share libs. If i modify a shared lib and want to test if my apps pass the tests, what is the best approach?

341713871,Error when passing baseUrl with value null or undefined to cypress.run,"### Current behavior:

When you pass a config to cypress.run and it contains the `baseUrl` param with the value `null` (which is its default value: https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration.html#Global) or `undefined` it throws the error: 

Expected 'baseUrl' to be a fully qualified URL (starting with http:// or https://). Instead the value was: ""null""

### Desired behavior:

Should execute the tests just like if you didn't pass the `baseUrl` param.

### Steps to reproduce:

This is a code similar to the one I tried to run:

```js
const cypress = require('cypress')

cypress

341139624,cy.url() and/or cy.location('href') does not return a string as documentation claims,"### Current behavior:
According to the documentation, Cy.url() should produce a string. I wanted to capture the current URL into a variable and then reference it after I run a custom Cypress command.

My question is, if cy.url() and cy.location('href') no longer return strings in `3.0.1` - how do we get that value?

### Desired behavior:
Expecting a string of the current URL; instead an object is received that looks like:
```
// JSON.stringify(cy.url())
{ ""chainerId"": ""chainer2504"", ""firstCall"": false }

// JSON.stringify(cy.location('href'))
{ ""chainerId"": ""chainer2558"", ""firstCall"": false }

Attempting to log either `cy.url()` or `cy.location('href')` does not result in a string as indicated by the documentation.

### Current behavior:

Test failure shows up in the Cypress app.

### Desired behavior:

In much the same way that you can do a Gulp notification using `gulp-notify` to show a system notification for, perhaps, an ESLint failure, it would be great to also be able to do this with Cypress when a test fails. The use case is running the Cypress app in the background running your tests against your local development environment while you develop. I have Cypress running and every time I save my JS files Cypress silently runs the tests. Unless I click over to the app and see I've broken something, I won't know that a test is failing.

This type of real-time feedback would be huge on every save to catch if you've just caused a regression to happen with your latest changes. I would love it if I didn't have to go back to the app to check if something is failing every time and be notified of this.

340996559,Is it possible to make beforeEach keep running if it fails because of `cy.url()`?,"### Current behavior:

When `beforeEach` fails in one test it stops the execution of all the tests after that.

### Desired behavior:

Is it possible to add an option to make the run keep going even if `beforeEach` fails once?
In my case I'm using `beforeEach` to log in into my application, but sometimes from clicking the ""Log in"" button until the page has loaded a lot of time passes and the `beforeEach` fails.

However, it's not like the application is failing, it's just taking a long time to load the page.

This is my code:
```js
beforeEach(function () {
        cy.visit('')

        cy.url()
            .should('contain','login')

        cy.get('#btnLoginOauth')
            .click()

        cy.get(""#Username"")
            .type(""rcarter"",{force:true})

        cy.get(""#Password"")
            .type(""pass"",{force:true})

        cy.get(""#btnLogin"")
            .click({timeout:10000})

        cy.url()
            .should('include', '/app/list')
    }))
```

My problem is that `cy.get(""#btnLogin"").click({timeout:10000})` takes a long time to load the page, and then `cy.url().should('include','/app/list')` fails because even if sometimes the page has loaded, it is still reading the old url and not the new one. I will give an example:
![error2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41155189/42690992-a6a840ae-86a6-11e8-86c8-3b053c1db85e.png)

This sometimes fails even if the page has loaded because the `cy.url()` is reading the old url and not the new page one.

Because of this I have two questions:
1) As I asked before, is it possible to add an option to beforeEach so it keeps running the tests even if it has failed once?
2) Is there a way to make `cy.url()` read the new page and not the old one?",question

340691445,Feature: natural language query functions for links and form elements,"I'd like to see Cypress add natural language query functions for links and standard form elements.

One of the nicest things about the [capybara](https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara) API is that it has a few tricks that make selecting links and form elements (the element types an integration test will interact with most frequently) queryable with the same natural language text that users will see. 

Here are a few examples from Capybara:

* `click_link('Link Text')`, `click_button('Button Text')`, `click_on('a link or a button')`
* `fill_in('First Name', with: 'John')`
* `check('A Checkbox')`, `uncheck('A Checkbox')`

And so on. None of these matchers are particularly challenging to implement, but they can dramatically improve the UX of a browser automation API, especially to people in non-typical developer roles. Additionally, selecting on text can improve the durability of a test suite against subsequent implementation changes, since you're coupling to text users can see and not markup.

This style has been found to have a few benefits over the years:

* The intent of the test is more apparent, especially in cases where the markup is obtuse or unclear (and where making the markup cleaner is outside the control of the tester)
* The test is less likely to break due to implementation changes that are unimportant to the user. If the label of a form element changes, however, that's almost always meaningful to _somebody_, since it's visible to the users. This has the effect of decreasing the occurrence of false negatives (tests that fail but for which nothing is broken)
* It encourages better a11y, in particular for form elements, which sadly still often fail to have proper `for` & `id` attribute matching. If the test can select a form element correctly based on given label text, so can a screen reader",enhancement

340124953,Calling .blur() on elements inside iframes throws an error,"### Current behavior:
When using Cypress together with Storybook there is an issue when calling `.blur()` on an element. Storybook render inside an iframe so my guess is that there is a bug in the `document.activeElement` check inside the `.blur()` function. We should probably loop through all iframes and find the correct `activeElement`. Using the `force` option solves the issue but I feel that this should work without that.

Note that this worked before 3.0.2. 

Error message
```
CypressError: cy.blur() can only be called on the focused element. Currently the focused element is a: <iframe id=""storybook-preview-iframe"" title=""preview"" src=""iframe.html?"" allowfullscreen="""" style=""width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;""></iframe>

When running a test using the Electron browser on a webpage that contains a `window.onbeforeunload` script and trying to navigate away, Cypress will fail to load the next page. The test will eventually fail after a PageLoadTimeout exception. This occurs when using any kind of navigation such as `cy.reload()`, `cy.visit()`, or interacting with an element that contains an `href` linking to somewhere else. 

Test run with Electron 59:
![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2985885/42521197-d6a6bffe-842d-11e8-8bb3-e3bccaa32df2.png)

### Steps to reproduce:
```js
describe('Electron 59 alert prompt bug', function() {
  it('Should navigate away from the page', function() {
    cy.on('window:confirm', function() {
      return true;
    });

  });
  it('Should reload the page', function() {
    cy.visit('http://localhost:8080/');
    cy.reload();
  });
});
```

The page under test needs to contain a `window.onbeforeunload` function which alters the returnValue. To reproduce, I use `http-server` to serve a barebones HTML file

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<script>
  window.onbeforeunload = function (e) {
    e.returnValue = 'Dialog';
    return;
  }

336461848,Cypress sets the height of the size-container to 0px,"Hi there,
### Current behavior:

I'm working on a single page web app that is built with React, React router 3.x and Redux. I use Cypress to test login, signup, create posts pages, etc. It all works well. But when I'm testing two particular pages. Their page height(on `.size-container` element) is sometimes set to `0px`(see the screenshot, click on the screenshot to get a bigger view). And so the page cannot be seen. The test can be passed when I reset the viewport with `cy.viewport()` after visiting the page with `cy.visit()` but then I ended up with so many `cy.viewport()` in my test suites.

These two particular pages are a bit different when compare with others:

334885415,Improvements/fixes for reading state.json,"In an attempt to mitigate [Cypress randomly hanging in CI](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1912), implement the following:

1. Add debug logs around reading/writing/locking/unlocking files, so if the issue occurs again, they'll hopefully provide more information
2. Stop the `state.json` file from being read during `run` mode. The last log before Cypress hanging is the `state.json` being read, so it's possible it is the cause. Since we solely persist state related to the GUI/browser in interactive mode, it's not necessary to read it at all during a run. This may solve the issue.
3. Add a timeout for unlocking a file. If the hanging is indeed caused by the `state.json`, it's likely it's actually unlocking the file that never resolves. It would be better to time out in this scenario, catch the timeout, and carry on without the file unlocked. There's already a timeout on getting a lock on the file, so subsequent read and writes will handle that accordingly.
4. Add a whitelist for keys that can be saved in `state.json`. Currently, it allows any arbitrary keys to be written to it, making it difficult to tell what state it actually can possibly contain. This will document the keys in the code.",enhancement

333975155,`Cypress.log` should log in the queue or at least support it as an option,"_This IMO falls somewhere in the grey area between bug and feature request. I picked ""bug"", because the current functionality seems clearly insufficient to properly achieve what's described [here](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/custom-commands.html#Command-Logging). If you consider it a feature request, please mark it as you will._

I want to create some custom commands to help interact with the UI library I'm using, e.g. `chooseSelectOption(valueLabel)` or `resolveModal(actionLabel)`. As hinted [here](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/custom-commands.html#Command-Logging), I'd like to log once (a single high-level message) for each command and mute the logging for the inner low-level commands, but see the inner assertions.

_Note that the following is just a demo example, not my real use-case._

### Current behavior:

If I write my command like this:

```javascript
function chooseSelectOption(valueLabel) {
  Cypress.log({ name: 'choose_option', message: valueLabel })
  cy.contains('.some-class', valueLabel, { log: false })
    .should('be.enabled')
    .click({ log: false })
}
```

it looks fine, when I call it once. But when I call it multiple times in a loop (say I have a multi-select thing going on):

```javascript
[ 'a', 'b', 'c' ].forEach(val => chooseSelectOption(val))
```

I get the following log:

```
CHOOSE_OPTION a
CHOOSE_OPTION b
CHOOSE_OPTION c
 - ASSERT expected <tag.some-class> to be enabled
 - ASSERT expected <tag.some-class> to be enabled
 - ASSERT expected <tag.some-class> to be enabled
```

### Desired behavior:

I'd expect to get a log like this:

```
CHOOSE_OPTION a
 - ASSERT expected <tag.some-class> to be enabled
CHOOSE_OPTION b
 - ASSERT expected <tag.some-class> to be enabled
CHOOSE_OPTION c
 - ASSERT expected <tag.some-class> to be enabled
```

I'm able to log into the queue using e.g. `wrap`:

```javascript
cy.wrap({ name: 'choose_option', message: valueLabel }, { log: false }).then(Cypress.log)
```

but that nests the messages:

```
 - CHOOSE_OPTION a
 - ASSERT expected <tag.some-class> to be enabled
 - CHOOSE_OPTION b
 - ASSERT expected <tag.some-class> to be enabled
 - CHOOSE_OPTION c
 - ASSERT expected <tag.some-class> to be enabled
```

making the log hard to read. I'd expect to be able to log from custom commands in the same fashion as the native Cypress commands.

_And while I'm at it, I'm fine with Cypress upper-casing the names of its commands in the log, but I have no idea why it's upper-casing mine (I'd say it's my business how I want them formatted and there are various reasons why not upper-casing them might be useful)._

333568843,Code in hooks and test are rerun when changing to a different superdomain,"### Current behavior:

When running my spec file, I noticed that some code in the `before` hook (not `beforeEach`) is being run before each of my three test cases, causing my checks to fail. Want to remark that I am using different superdomains for every test, I don't see this when I run all the tests with the same superdomain.

### Desired behavior:

Code in the `before` hook only runs once, before all the tests, no matter if using different superdomains.

### Steps to reproduce:

I explain my setup. My spec file consists of:
```
- before()
- after()
- it() //superdomain 1
- it() //superdomain 2 using an iframe
- it() //superdomain 1
```
As I am using different superdomains, the only way that I've read to do it is visiting the different domains in different tests (https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/web-security.html#One-Superdomain-per-Test)

I've also set `""chromeWebSecurity"": false`

Within the before hook I run several requests to some endpoints as a way to get some data that I will use through the tests; Get it once, and use it across the three it().

I've also set a `console.log('This only happens in the beforeHook:  ' + var)` to see what's the value of my variable, and this is what I see in the run:

- Running the first it()
![11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36962817/41585039-2a6d3f68-73a9-11e8-9f88-2b1af0b39c9d.png)
 
- Second it()
![22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36962817/41585064-3f228198-73a9-11e8-9efd-486a1a694cfb.png)

- Third it()
![33](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36962817/41585078-46bf23fc-73a9-11e8-895e-4f66307a6fa2.png)

After every `it()` the console gets cleared, which is fine, but I don't expect to see the log again during the second and the third tests, as this is supposed to run only once. Notice how the variable gets an increment for each loop, as I would expect had I done it in a `beforeEach` hook.

In the left side of the window every seems fine as there is no command logging for the `before` hook when running the second and third tests, but the `console.log` reveals that.

333088394,Testing the tests.,"This is neither an issue nor a feature request, as I am quite satisfied with the atomic patterns with which I can control the way that Cypress runs and how I can step through the tests when they fail, but I am working on the generational production of a large battery of tests based on generic types hydrated from a resource that also scaffolds the vuex store, localstorage and vue (using Quasar). 

My components and logic are all unit tested, I am using the electron version of vue-devtools to watch state and events, I personally test critical external modules and cypress guarantees that vuex and vue collaborate properly during runtime - but... 

My tests are generational and only exist in memory during the run - so how can I test my tests to make sure that they (or more rather the code itself) has 100% coverage? 

Does anyone have any experience in this admittedly silly exercise or recommendations about similar work? I have thought about wrapping the cypress tests in [tap](https://github.com/tapjs/node-tap), but I am pretty sure that cypress won't really like that double-bootstrapping. I also thought about using cy.exec() in each step, but cy.task() almost seems more appropriate. Anyway, I would totally appreciate any ideas or pointers here...",question
333085478,contain.text and include.text should do substring matches but instead do full-string matches,"### Current behavior:

```js
    // cy.get('div#preview').should('have.text', 'Hello');     // this is a full match, but we want a partial match, to ignore newlines etc.
    // cy.get('div#preview').should('contain.text', 'Hello');  // bug: this does the same as have.text
    // cy.get('div#preview').should('include.text', 'Hello');  // bug: this also does the same as have.text
    cy.get('div#preview').then((el)=> {
      assert.include(el.text(), 'Hello');  // this works but it isn't pretty
    });
```

the log for all three of the above says:
```
ASSERT: expected <div#preview> to have text Hello, but the text was Hello\n
```
which makes me think that there might be some aliasing going on since I'd think the error messages for ""include"" and ""contain"" would say ""include"" and ""contain"", not ""have

### Desired behavior:

* `have.text` should test whether the element's full text is equal to the given string
* `contain.text` and `include.text` should test whether the element's text *contains* the given string but is not necessarily *equal* to it

333056005,General App Setup,"### Current behavior:
We have an initial localization (using [i18-react](https://github.com/alexdrel/i18n-react)) setup once our app loads:

```js
import { defaultLanguage, setLanguage } from ""../../src/i18n"";

setLanguage(defaultLanguage);
```

i18n.js file:

```js
import T from 'i18n-react';


let currentLang = '';
export const defaultLanguage = 'en';


const languages = {
  'en': require('../locale/en.json')
};


/**
 * @param {string} lang Language
 */
export function setLanguage(lang) {
  if (!(lang in languages)) {
    lang = defaultLanguage;
  }
  currentLang = lang;
  T.setTexts(Object.assign({}, languages[defaultLanguage], languages[lang]));
}
```

We run this once when our app loads, and we thought of placing this under `support/index.js`. Not sure if that's the proper spot. In any case, our string comparison fails when we try to use the `T.translate` function. It turns out our `T` object in our spec files is now a different `T` object than the one we used to setLanguage on, which makes it impossible for us to test for strings. 
Our current workaround is to place the `setLanguage` function at the top of each spec file, but we obviously want to stop doing that.

What are we doing wrong? Is there a better place to have this function run?

### Desired behavior:
`T` object is the same singleton shared across the entire test cycle, just like in the real application.

### Steps to reproduce:
I guess you can just install the `i18n-react` package and use the code above. Then you can see that `T.translate(STRING_KEY)` never finds its translation since the `this.texts` property in `T` is always null since the `T` object is a different one.

332623555,Creating route alias using post processed fixture data (Blob) is not returning that data,"### Current behavior:

My Angular 5 app makes an HTTP GET request to a remote server which returns an image as a Blob. My existing Cypress specs using the remote server correctly verify the response data is received.

I'd like to stub out the call to the remote server and wrote this spec that loads a JPEG file from disk using a fixture (which returns a dataURI) and then I convert that to a Blob and supply it to `cy.route` (using the same route minimatch expression that is matched in my non-stubbed request).

in the cypress command log the XHR Stub is being hit and it is returning a Blob of size 2 of type application/json instead of my actual Blob. The `cy.wait` for the alias also prints Blob size2 application/json to the console.

Here's my spec:

```js
// spec
describe('Test using fixture to supply image as a Blob', function () {
  before(() => {
    cy.server();
    cy.fixture('images/map.jpeg').then(dataURI => {
      console.log(dataURI);
       return Cypress.Blob.base64StringToBlob(dataURI, ""image/jpeg"").then((blob) => {

      })
    });
  })
  it('test that causes app to call '@imageXHR'), function() {
    ...
  })

```
The `console.log` statements print what you'd expect - the first is a long data URI and the second is 
a `Blob {size: 41191, type: ""image/jpeg""}`.

Cypress has an option to permanently delete those files, not only move them to trash (to avoid similar issue with the `.Trash` directory itself)

1. CI agent is deleting `/artifacts` directory.
2. CI agent is recreating this directory, as a non-privileged users, so that it looks like:

```

4. Test passes.
1. Next test is about to run on the very same agent. Agent fails to delete `/results/videos/lorem.mp4` - it has no write access to `videos/` and `screenshots/`, because they were created as root.

npm start

# in another term
npm run cypress

329216685,Stubbing node methods for electron apps not working,"### Is this a Feature or Bug?

Feature. The FAQ says it'll work with a little extra code and I looked through the cypress specs you guys use for testing the cypress electron browser, but I did not see any stubbing node methods. ie fs methods etc. 

This may be a feature request for enhanced docs. Nobody in the chat responded to this question. I've asked three times on gitter now so I gave my best to not file a bug for this question.

I've found https://github.com/cypress-io/env-or-json-file/blob/ef205312ba73f2fd6404947005b1a401cb6dd305/src/env-or-json-file-spec.js#L43 which looks promising but I don't think these specs are ran using Cypress? Regardless I tried to copy what was done in this spec without success.

And the FAQ points to https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/tree/develop/packages/desktop-gui/cypress/integration but I don't see any node methods being stubbed. Am I just missing it?

### Current behavior:

Stubbing like this doesn't work.
```js
const fs = require('fs');
it('does something', () => {
  cy.stub(fs, 'readFileSync').returns('file contents'); // Errors: fs does not have method 'readFileSync'
});
```
Nor does this work.
```js
const fs = require('fs');
it('does something', () => {
  fs.readFileSync = function() {
    return 'file contents';
  };
  cy.find('.btn-which-invokes-readFileSync')
    .click(); // Error: Empty fs object required in project different than empty fs object required here in test. readFileSync method not defined.
});
```
### Desired behavior:

To be able to stub node methods using first example above.

### Steps to reproduce:

See Current Behavior section.

I'd like to know if it's possible, or if it isn't, to make a suggestion to add support for using `Jasmine` instead of `Chai`.

In my humble opinion, it works better and it's more complete than Chai. Most of the frontend projects that I have seen use it (behind Jest, mainly), including (not exclusively, but the majority) React and Angular ecosystems.

Thanks!

Bug

### Current behavior:

Calling `.check()` on a radio button will *visually* check it but the `onclick` code doesn't run.  This was not the case with 2.1.0

### Desired behavior:

Calling `.check()` on a radio button should trigger the `onclick` handler.

### Steps to reproduce:

I'm not 100% sure what the cause is.  I created a simple HTML file to test this on and it worked as expected, so maybe Cypress 3.0 handles a more complicated DOM differently.  I can't post the actual HTML I'm testing on since it is a company product.

Bug

### Current behavior:

<!-- images, stack traces, etc -->
We have an internal framework that our other apps use for general things, where Cypress is one of them.
Our config is placed in this framework so that the consuming apps only need to write specs.
I noticed that the `pluginsFile` config does not behave like the other path based configs.

In the image below, the `supportFile` correctly points to `/frameworkpath/../support/command.js`, however the `pluginsFile`, written in the exact same manner, points to `/consumingAppPath/frameworkPath/../support/command.js` which does not exist. It seems like the path is prefixed with `process.cwd()` no matter what.

### Desired behavior:
supportsFile config should be configurable to point to a supportsFile without forcing a `process.cwd()` prefix, making it impossible to have general plugin config when using a shared framework for frontend applications.

Maybe some fluency will work here:

cy.route(""POST"", ""/endpoint"").where().its(""body"").contains(""<B/>"").as(""B"")
````

And a general use escape hatch like `cy.server({ whitelist: ... })` per route will also work nicely.
```js
cy.route(""POST"", ""/endpoint"", (xhr) => isInRouteA(xhr)).as(""A"")
cy.route(""POST"", ""/endpoint"", (xhr) => isInRouteB(xhr)).as(""B"")
```

I personally think the escape hatch solution works better. Simply due to the huge variety in how applications use async requests.

327599471,Promises call inside cy.wait don't fail tests,"### Current behavior:

I have something that annoys me a lot. I'm testing an AWS S3 upload with cypress. The last step of my test is to query the AWS S3 bucket with the js AWS SDK. The end of my test looks like this :
```js
    // We wait on our previously tagged request and then verify that the file exists on S3 !
    cy.wait('@uploadPut').then(resp => {
      const etag = resp.response.headers.etag
      const params = {
        Bucket: Cypress.env('videoBucket'),
        Key: fileName + 'jfj' // introduce error here
      }
      // This crashes (uncaught promise) but everything still green with Cypress 
      s3.headObject(params).promise()
        .then(data => {
          expect(data.ContentType).to.equal(type)
          expect(data.ETag).to.equal(etag)
        })

      // Cypress is not too kind with Promises throwing error in cy.wait, e.g

      // This expect crashes but main test is still green
      // Promise.resolve('wow').then(resp => {
      //   expect(null).not.to.be.null
      // })

      // This expect crashes too but main test is still green
      // return s3.headObject(params).promise().then(res => {
      //   expect(null).not.to.be.null
      // })
    })
```

Promises are behaving very strangely inside cy.wait() and I didn't find any problem similar to mine. I'm just trying to make the test fail gracefully with a good error message. The only workaround I found was to return the call to s3.headObject(params).promise(). That will make the test fail but the error message is really bad.

In most cases, this is fine since most tests aren't going to have screenshots in them.

It complains about a failing Regexp, but the weird thing is that this never causes a problem in a normal browser, and in fact, even within the Cypress browser, if I open a new tab and reload the code, it works perfectly. And I also added on Cypress.on('uncaught.exception') to my code, which does not seem to help.

Here's my test script:
```js
const uuid = require('cuid');
Cypress.on('uncaught:exception', (err, runnable) => {
  return false;
});

describe('My First Test', function() {
  it('finds the content ""type""', function() {

Here you see two tabs of the same browser, consistently showing completely different behaviour (even when reloading etc). What's very strange is that when I deploy this in 30 different browsers using Kubernetes, I get half of them failing with this error, and the other half working normally! Perhaps this is a timing issue (the reason for the non-determinism) with some interaction between my code and Cypress test code?

### Current behavior: <!-- (images, stack traces, etc) -->
I've installed Cypress into a project built on VSTS. To get cypress to run on the Linux Hosted agents I had to perform the following additional steps:

```
apt-get -qq -y update
apt-get -qq -y install xvfb libgtk2.0-0 libnotify-dev libgconf-2-4 libnss3 libxss1 libasound2
```

To get reporting to work (to get status information in the VSTS release dashboard) I configured the `junit` reporter:

```
cypress run --reporter junit
```

This works up to a certain point. Cypress runs, a junit report is generated, but all of the recorded videos are ignored after the run is completed.

VSTS supports uploading test attachments when they are referenced in the test report. I tried configuring the `xunit-file` reporter, but no attachment is added. I tried configuring the `mocha-trx-reporter` (native visual studio format), but it crashes when running with cypress.

However I open an actual PowerShell or CMD prompt and run `npm run cypress:open` cypress seems to work fine.

I remember investigating this a bit ago, and we never understood root cause, but there are differences between the environment variables that might have effect.

For example the terminal in VS Code has these extra stuff like which the native terminals do not.

I don't know if any of these are suspicious or why the _addition_ of them would hurt, but I think this issue is an easy problem for new comers to get caught up on since many people use terminals integrated into their editor.  Also, one of Cypress's main talking points was that it is easier to get started than traditional/selenium based solutions. I assume it's just oddities with Windows and ROI is low, but it might be an easy fix for someone who is familiar with this stuff.

Or if it is not easily fixed maybe at least the error can be detected so it tells people, you're running from environment X which is not supported, please use Y.

316254216,Flakey AJAX requests when using Cypress.on('fail') and the test runner,"### Current behavior:

When using the `Cypress.on('fail', function(err, runnable) {});` method I am posting an AJAX request to our application like so:

```js
    Cypress.on('fail', function(err, runnable) {
      // we now have access to the err instance
      // and runnable this failed on
        setTimeout(function() {
          axios.post('https://site.com', {
            error_message: runnable.err.message,
          })
          .then(function (res) {
            console.log(res);
          })
          .catch(function (error) {
            console.log(error);
          });
        }, 0);
        throw err;
    });
```

Not sure why but runnable won't work unless I wrap it in a function or timeout, but that is another issue so don't get confused by it.

When using `npx cypress open` and then selecting my spec the AJAX request sends every time without any issues.

However if I run my tests using `npx cypress run` on my CircleCI job the AJAX request is very flakey. Sometimes it sends and sometimes it doesn't. I'm guessing this is because the test runner is killing the spec before the AJAX request can be sent.

### Desired behavior:

I'd like to know how we can stop the spec from being killed until the request has been successfully sent. I've already tried using `cy.wait` but this doesn't work.

Is there a way that I can manually fail a test in the promise on my AJAX request?

### Steps to reproduce:

Run an AJAX request inside of `Cypress.on('fail')` and then use the `npx cypress run` command. Alternatively any logic that can take a bit of time within here such as a `setTimeout` can't be ran.

316170909,How to click and draw with openlayers. Possible or Not?,"I asked this a lot of time on forms and chats.. But never get an answer back. So this time I'm writing it here as an issue.

I'm searching for weeks how to create some tests with openlayers. I can't find anything on the internet, but it should be possible right? So who can help me with this?

**Situation:**

There's created a map (sort of google maps) with angular / openlayers. What I need is to click on this map (coordinates) and draw on it (for example a polygon). 

For example go to the website https://openlayers.org/en/latest/examples/draw-features.html. Select here by Geometry type for point to click on the map or polygon to draw a polygon on the map. It has to be possible to get this in my test right?

**So the tests what I want to do is like:**

**Test 01:**
1. Go to https://openlayers.org/en/latest/examples/draw-features.html
2. Choose Geometry type ""point""
3. Click on map

**Test 02:**
1. Go to https://openlayers.org/en/latest/examples/draw-features.html

### Current behavior: <!-- (images, stack traces, etc) -->
Started up a new Angular app (`ng new cypress-test`), installed Cypress, did `ng serve`, wrote a simple test just visiting the home page and looking for the sample text, and that test ran fine.
Then, added in a `<link>` to the Bootstrap CDN in the app's `index.html` and suddenly the Cypress test cranks for exactly 30 seconds (the status bar in Chrome says ""Establishing secure connection...""), and then runs the test, but prints out a timeout error to the console:

Tried this with Font Awesome, and some Google Fonts, and all 3, and it still takes 30 seconds, so it's not an issue with slow responses from the external resource; there seems to be some issue with those links in the `<head>` section that Cypress doesn't like.

### Desired behavior:
The tests load the application's pages in roughly the same time as loading them normally via localhost is.

### Steps to reproduce:

1. Clone https://github.com/jdhines/cypress-test

4. In another terminal window, open Cypress (I used `npx cypress open`)

All other stories were complete except this section...

## Interactive Mode

- Continue enabling users to ""Run all Tests""
- Enable clicking folders to automatically run a subset of specs
- Instead of killing the renderer process between specs the browser will simply be ""navigated"" to the next spec URL.
- This will isolate each spec, and be much faster and less abrupt than killing the renderer like we will for the CLI. However this makes sense considering Cypress already has the code for swapping the URL and rehydrating the state of the reporter. We already do this when swapping domains in a cy.visit.
- Isolating specs will help with memory exhaustion, but its still possible to blow out on a very long and intense spec file.
- To solve this we'll begin purging snapshots by reducing the default minimum of 50, down to 5.
- Purged snapshots will only affect passing tests and we will not purge data for failing tests. This will enable users to review the commands and output for failed tests - as they likely don't care about the data for passing tests anyway.
- We'll need to add a good user experience / messaging around why snapshots were purged
- When running multiple specs we'll add the spec file as part of the command log which will give you a shortcut for focusing in on a spec file.

@jennifer-shehane we'll need you to comp some UI changes related to communicating to the users about running too many tests in Interactive Mode.

All that I am expecting is to be able to test my download action from the Cypress test. 

If I trigger the download button using something like: 
```js
cy.get('[data-cy=download-file]').click();
```
I expect to get a positive response from the test if the file was actually downloaded.

### How to reproduce:

Note: It would be great if you can try this steps using a **Genesis UI** theme as the base application.

1. Create a form template with a button pointing to the `.ts` method on the (click) parameter:
   `(click)=""downloadFile()""`
Note: Include a `data-cy` parameter as part of the button in the form:
   `data-cy=""download-file""`
2. Inside the `.ts` method use the instruction, ensuring to use a valid path: 
   `window.location.href = '/path/to/file/for/download';`
3. Write a Cypress test when you try to trigger the download button from the form. Something like:
   `cy.get('[data-cy=download-file]').click();`
4. You should get a timeout message similar to the one included as attached image.

#### Test code:

```js
cy.get('[data-cy=download-file]').click(); 
```

312115911,Proposal: .pipe command that is essentially a retryable .then,"Proposal: Command that is essentially a retryable .then

Example:
```ts
const getTable = id => cy.get(`[data-testid=${id}`)
const getColumnNames = $el => Array.from($el.find('[role=columnheader]')).map(el => el.innerText)

getTable('identifier')
  .then(getColumnNames) // The `should` doesn't cause this to re-evaluate
  .should('deep.equal', ['Column One', 'Column Two'])

The `getTable` will get an element given a test id and `getColumnNames` will get the text contents of a table's column headers. If the table's column headers aren't statically known (maybe column order is a user preference), the assertion immediately fails.

I don't think we want `.then` to retry. I think it is good that `.then` has strong guarantees that it will only be run once. It just makes composition of functions not quite fit.

There could be another command that does re-run if there is an assertion:

### Current behavior:

Authentication is currently handled through Github login only.

### Desired behavior:

Support authentication through SSO.

Right now, our team is required to authenticate through LastPass's SSO service when using third-party tools to meet set security requirements. For this reason, we're unable to use the Cypress dashboard. I'm sure other organizations have similar requirements, so this would be a handy feature to have. Of course, the alternative would be self-hosting the dashboard. Until that's possible, simply having SSO support would go a long way, and would be much simpler to put together.

I looked into Auth0's documentations, and it seems implementing SSO may be straight-forward using their [Universal Login](https://auth0.com/docs/hosted-pages/login#single-sign-on-sso-) tools.

303437991,Endurance testing with Cypress,"### Current behavior:
A small note about performance testing being one of the things you don't do with Cypress.
https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/trade-offs.html#Automation-restrictions

### Desired behavior:
So we've written a heap of Cypress tests for different end user workflows through our product and now we're looking for ways to simulate a user using the platform over the course of several hours (our goal is 8h+)

* Ability to maintain a single browser session across multiple tests.

* Chain existing tests together. At the conclusion of a test, specify the next test to run in the test sequence. This allows for different user workflows to be created dynamically at run-time. The tests should still execute as separate tests to facilitate separate reporting on the different user workflows instead of just capturing success / failure of the whole workflow.

* Memory snapshots and statistics capture from snapshots to help with memory leak detection.

* Different (configurable) compensation strategies:
   - On application error, terminate the current browser session and establish a new one.
   - On application error, log the error and continue within the current browser session.
   - On application error, stop the test (pretty much what happens now).

* Capture statistics to identify executions that took longer / shorter (standard deviation metrics).

* Errors are captured and aggregated together for statistical reporting (I.E. spec 1 failed 88 times out of 100)

* All of the above captured into the Dashboard service

* Stretch goal: Run multiple instances across different browsers concurrently to do stress testing. Failure rate and other metrics captured on per browser basis. (This one seems less likely to happen given the comments on the link above)

So there's a starting point for our feature wish list (I realize these aren't small things). This might get quickly closed as falling under the banner of performance testing but I hope it can spark some further discussion because there actually aren't that many tools out there that can consistently mimic an end user to the simplicity and extend of Cypress. I know a good chunk of this functionality can be delivered with the existing framework components (Plugins, Cypress Events, Uncaught exception handling) but my hope is that Cypress may consider, or are planning in the future to go into this space as a first-class solution offering long running testing within the Cypress framework and Dashboard service.",enhancement

I understand the recommended way to use cypress is closures, however, when dealing with multiple variables, we run into callback hell's lil' brother **closure hell**.

It can also throw an error or reject the promise to fail the command.

When running a cypress test of an Angular 5 application which has been web-packed, a chunk is asynchronously loaded from the web server. This chunk is malformed (somewhere in the pipeline) consistently on the same byte of the same file each time.

### How to reproduce:
I'm not really sure on a reproduction.

_Q: Is there a way I can bypass the cypress network stack for individual assets to try and identify if this is the cypress proxy or something else at play?_

Here's what I know so far... 

The test throws the following error consistently in the same place of the test.

If you open the chunk file from a Chrome browser having run the application normally you see:
`__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__angular_core__[""ɵand""]`

However, when the error is thrown, the chunk contains the following:
`__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__angular_core__[""��and""]`

cypress_runner.js:138954 Uncaught TypeError: __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__angular_core__.��and is not a function

When Cypress detects uncaught errors originating from your application it will automatically fail the current test.

This behavior is configurable, and you can choose to turn this off by listening to the 'uncaught:exception' event.

301209836,Sharing dynamic data between all the tests in a run.,"### Is this a Feature or Bug?
Feature.

### Current behavior:
Currently the only way I can figure out to generate user login data with faker for each run and share it amongst  all the tests in that run is to stuff it into the environment variables. This is fine apart from in development when I want to do iterative runs with fresh data.
Currently to get the plugin to run again and populate the environment vars with fresh data I have to stop and start Cypress.

### Desired behavior:
Maybe a reboot button on the UI.
Or a hook to inject environment variables into the config before each run.
Or a mechanism to share data between all your tests in a run other than stuffing the env object.

300997400,Cypress & Serenity-js integration,"### Desired behavior:
As discussed yesterday with @bahmutov @RandallKent and Jan Molak of Serenity-js. I want to see if we are able to integrate cypress with serenity. This will be a place to discuss this and review it.

### why?
Serenity-js can be handy in multiple ways:
* Support the BDD process with the screenplay pattern. Serenity-js uses tasks that represents business language. The outcome can be a SerenityBDD report which can serve as living documentation (if the BDD process is correctly implemented)
* It can help the non-technical tester to contribute more in testing. By using components in the screenplay pattern in the form of a DSL, it is easier to contribute and read the tests.

### The challenges:
* Serenity-js uses the standard es6 promises. Cypress uses there own Chainable promises. I found a way to convert this (see the example) but it is not pretty. We need to figure out a nice way to do these transformations.
* Serenity now uses protractor and records the events and writes them in the process straight to the file system. Since the tests of cypress run in the browser, this is not possible. A solution would be to send the events to the process who can pick it up and then do the same it already did, writing it to a file.

I'm building a tool for PayPal called `paypal-scripts` (similar to `react-scripts`). One of the purposes is to cover 80% of the use cases by hiding all configuration from the user of the tool so they can focus on just writing the code. If they _do_ create a `cypress.json` file then we'll use that one, but for most people they should be able to just use the built-in configuration of `paypal-scripts` and they wont need to have and maintain a `cypress.json` file at all. There's honestly not a lot of configuration we'd need (mostly the `baseUrl` I think), but a lot of the value proposition of `paypal-scripts` is that people don't need to worry about configuring anything and it all just works out of the box.

I'm able to do this with `eslint`, `babel`, and many other tools, but I can't currently do it with `cypress` and I'd like to be able to do that if possible :) Thoughts?",enhancement

Using cypress as a node module and passing a config object including a string with a comma results in unexpected behaviour. String including commas is split up and passed as additional properties. 

### How to reproduce:
Using for eg a multireporter and calling the cypress runner in a nodejs script.

```js
cypress.run({
    reporter: 'mocha-multi-reporters',
    reporterOptions: {
        reporterEnabled: 'JSON, Spec',
        jsonReporterOptions: {
            toConsole: true
        },
    }
};
```


which calls the run function in lib/cypress.js. 
After line 22
`options = util.normalizeModuleOptions(options);`
the passed options object is transformed to
`reporter: 'mocha-multi-reporters',  
reporterOptions: 'reporterEnabled=JSON, Spec,jsonReporterOptions=[object Object]'`

which results in the wrong object (eg at open_project.js, function create)
```
...

      { reporterEnabled: 'JSON',
        Spec: undefined,
        jsonReporterOptions: 'object Object'
     }

```
'Spec' is not part of the property reporterEnabled anymore.  Also the jsonReporterOptions is not resolved correctly.

294661054,Proposal: Add a group to commands for nicer command logging,"I've been playing around with ways of defining reusable helpers (blog post coming) and have been using the Cypress log API and passing `{ log: false }` to allow control of the log output of these helpers/commands. This has been useful, but there are some times that I want to dive into that abstraction (most likely on failure) to see what step of the helper failed.

I think a concept of a `group` would be useful here. Instead of passing `{ log: false }` to every encapsulated command, having a group would help a lot more

### Current behavior:
```js

### Proposed behavior:
```js
export const createTodo = (name) => {
  const group = Cypress.group({
    name: 'createTodo',
    message: name,
    consoleProps() {
      return {
        'Inserted Todo': name,

  return cy
    .get('.todo-list')
    .contains('li', name.trim())
    .then($el => { group.set({ $el }).snapshot().end() })
```

Matching the log API seems like a logical choice. In the UI it would show `createTodo` with the logging the same as the `Current behavior` example, but would have an arrow that would expand to the grouped commands. This would both simplify creating custom command output (don't have to pass `{ log: false }` to everything) as well as make it easier to understand that's going on under the hood of a custom command. The group would be collapsed by default and expanded if a nested command failed.

Bug

### Current behavior:

When an error in my application is triggered in the console 'SyntaxError: Unexpected token u in JSON at position 0' Tests are stopped and failed. This is failure in the application but should have no affect on whether cypress passed or fails.

SyntaxError: Unexpected token u in JSON at position 0
SyntaxError: Unexpected token u in JSON at position 0
    at JSON.parse (<anonymous>)
    at https://www.fakeURLinsertedhere.com/:2382:34


### Desired behavior:

This should not fail or stop the test in any way as the test has not failed.


### How to reproduce:
Insert this error in your application, it will fail. This was confirmed by Jonathan Greenemeier @6eDesign in the Cypress Gitter chat.


#### Test code:

```
describe('Smoke', function () {
  it('.should() - assert that <title> is correct', function () {
    cy.visit('https://www.fakeURLinsertedhere.com.au/')
    cy.title().should('include', 'Ttile')

  })

### Current behavior:
`cy.writeFile` will only overwrite. In order to append, you have to read a file (making sure it already exists...), add the contents of that file to what you want to append to it in memory, and then do another writeFile call. 

### Desired behavior:
add a `{""append"": true}` option to `cy.writeFile`.

293284247,Element visibility fixes,"There are multiple issues regarding elements being calculated as visible when they are hidden OR elements being calculated as hidden when they are visible. This issue is generally to be used to track the progress made for these fixes.

I think that it is interesting to note that jQuery ditched their visibility calculations in 3.0 and is likely worthwhile looking into why/how they made these decisions. 

> An element is considered now visible if it has a layout box returned from the DOM getClientRects() method, even if that box has a height and/or width of zero. This means that elements such as <br /> or an empty <span> element that don't have height are considered to be visible.

* [x] 'visible' assertion says visible for elements cropped by parent element with overflow: hidden https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4161
* [x] When 'is.visible' failure, error shows 'is being covered by another element: undefined' https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1379

## Not reproducible issues
* **Not reproducible** Element is hidden by parent but `should('not.be.visible')` fails https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/683
* **Not reproducible** Cypress doesn't handle visibility assertions for fixed or/and transform: translate https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2558

### Desired behavior:
* Find a better way to more accurately determine visibility. 
* Always display reason why we determine something as visible or not visible.
* Add tests for all failing cases above - get tests passing

292196566,input selectionStart/selectionEnd incorrect during type(),"Firstly, thanks for Cypress, it's great!

- Cypress Version: 1.4.1
- Browser Version: Chrome 63

### Is this a Feature or Bug?
Bug

### Current behavior:
selectionStart and selectionEnd do not match expected cursor during `.type()` when position modified by  `{left|rightArrow}`

### Desired behavior:
selectionStart and selectionEnd **should match cursor _during_** `.type()`

### How to reproduce:
html file with `<input type=""text"" id=""#input"" />`

#### Test code:

```js
describe('musses up cursor position', () => {
  it('fails', () => {
    cy
      .visit('') // localhost
      .get('#input')
      .then(($el) => {
        $el.on('input', ({ target: { value, selectionStart, selectionEnd } }) =>
          console.log('typing', value, selectionStart, selectionEnd) // incorrect
        );
        return $el;
      })
      .clear()
      .type('abcde{leftArrow}{leftArrow}f')
      // these are not really what I'm testing 
      // I'm relying on these values during type()

We have an input listener that converts latin chars `romaji` into kana `ろまじ` during input, and relies on selectionStart/End in order to handle any mid text insertion, and then replaces the cursor to the correct position after conversion (the input value length can change `ryo` => `りょ` 3 => 2). The functionality works correctly when manually testing in Chrome, but not with Cypress.

I can work around it for my particular use-case by forcing an update with the (manually calculated) correct position but ideally the input should have the correct values during typing:
```js
it('converts characters inserted mid-text after cursor movement', () => {
  // already bound input listener that does all the conversion handling
  cy
    .get('#input')
    .type('wanakana')
    .should('have.value', 'わなかな') // passes
    .type('{leftArrow}{leftArrow}shi') // now 'わなshiかな'
     // usually `shi` would be converted instantly after 
     // the `i` input event that is fired in type()
     // but selectionRange was incorrectly 7,7 at that time
    .then(($el) => {
      $el.get(0).setSelectionRange(5, 5);
      return $el;
    })
    .trigger('input')
    .should('have.value', 'わなしかな'); // passes only due to .then().trigger()
});

### Is this a Feature or Bug? Bug


### Current behavior:
My project uses a css-in-js library (in this case [cxs](https://github.com/jxnblk/cxs)) to apply styling. The cxs library appends a style tag to the `<head>` at runtime and adds style definitions to this injected tag.
When tests run normally, styling appears as expected.
However, when switching between snapshots, injected style tags (css-in-js) is not preserved and styling is broken on the page

### Desired behavior:
Styles should be preserved, or the javascript bundle should be reran so that styles can be injected again.

(although the second option sounds less likely to be reliable given the nature of snapshotting).

### How to reproduce:
Run Cypress with a project that uses a css-in-js library that appends a style tags in `<head>` at run time.

### Additional Info (images, stack traces, etc)

290285010,How to deal with dynamic class names à la CSS Modules or Styled Components?,"Any pointers on how to deal with dynamic class names produced by e.g. CSS Modules or `styled-components`?

The easy way out would be to just plaster my markup with `id=""e2e-blabla""` but that doesn't feel particularly nice to be honest.

Another way could be to look for partial matches in class names. For example the CSS Modules class `.form` produces the actual class name `.styles__form--3gcRC` in the DOM. One could now use a CSS attr selector such as `[class*=form]` which would work in many case but can lead to name conflicts and kinda removed all the benefits of having locally scoped and unique class names.

290099158,Server needs promise-based way to communicate with driver,"## Feature

When the client code (running in the spec iframe) stubs a network request it might have logic to execute. For example if the delay for the resource is not a constant but should be determined dynamically the test might do this

```js
it('delays', () => {
  cy.route({
   url: '/foo',
   delay: (req) => 500
  })
})
```

This ""traffic rule"" should be sent to the server's network proxy module that handles stubbing. We cannot send the callback function `delay: (req) => 500`, so it gets stripped when passing message from the client to the network proxy module. The module is running in the Node process. When it needs to handle the request it has a problem - how does it call `delay` callback?

We have three problems: 

- we cannot just strip `delay` callback and forget about it.
- network proxy module should send a message to the client saying ""call delay callback""
- the client should be able to _respond_ back to the server after calling the delay callback

## Proposal

When stripping callback functions from traffic rules, we are going to collect all callbacks into an object by unique id.

```js
// before sending rule
const r = {
  url: '/foo',
  delay: (req) => 500
}
// after
const toSend = {
  url: '/foo',
  delay: '__message:a1234'
}
const callbacks = {
  __message:a1234: (req) => 500
}
```

On the server side, when reconstructing traffic rule object we put method proxies

```js
// on the server we receive
const received = {
  url: '/foo',
  delay: '__message:a1234'
}
// and make into
const rule = {
  url: '/foo',
  delay: (...args) => callClientCallback('__message:a1234', ...args)
}
```

The function `callClientCallback` uses socket message to communicate to the client, but it also registers 1 time unique _receiver_ message name to receive reply and resolve its promise.

```js
function callClientCallback(name, ...args) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const replyId = '__reply:' + _.random(1, 1e+6)
    socket.emit('client:async', name, ...args)
    socket.on(replyId, (data) => {
     socket.remove(replyId) // used once
    })
  })
}
```

The network layer thus can transparently get specific delay or other values from the test's callbacks.

I have implemented rudimentary solution in https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/commits/collect-traffic-rules but the communication needs to be tighten up and made general.

288625757,Do not fail test run if recording without record key for pull requests from forked repos,"## improvement

We currently stop tests if the user wants to record the test run but has not passed record key. This becomes a problem when someone submits a pull request from a forked repository. Example in https://travis-ci.org/bahmutov/cypress-react-unit-test/builds/328887786

```
$ npm test -- --record
> cypress-react-unit-test@0.0.0-development test /home/travis/build/bahmutov/cypress-react-unit-test
> cypress run ""--record""
You passed the --record flag but did not provide us your Record Key.
You can pass us your Record Key like this:
  cypress run --record --key <record_key>
You can also set the key as an environment variable with the name CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY.
https://on.cypress.io/how-do-i-record-runs
npm ERR! Test failed.  See above for more details.
The command ""npm test -- --record"" exited with 1.
```

This is a very common case for public repos - and every pull request will have tests fail without even running.

## Proposal

Maybe a better solution would be for the test runner to
- detect `--record` flag without record key. 
- check if running in a fork pull request (look at environment variables like https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#Default-Environment-Variables) then show a warning, skip recording *but run the tests*",enhancement

287735269,Allow reusing cy.server() in several tests and hooks,"### Is this a Feature or Bug?

Feature.

### Current behavior:

`cy.server()` is reset after each test case (`it`) is run. This makes impossible things like this:

```
describe
-> before :: something that needs to wait for a XHR request
-> it :: several tests waiting for requests
```

We could do:

```
describe
-> before :: set up cy.server()
-> before :: something that needs to wait for a XHR request
-> it :: several tests waiting for requests
```

But the second test will fail as current server will have been reset (it's reset [here](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/2b2b6d99a9f1bf232d9c7396b25390913d5f2b18/packages/driver/src/cy/commands/xhr.coffee#L233)).

We could do:

```
describe
-> before :: set up cy.server() for before hooks
-> before :: something that needs to wait for a XHR request
-> beforeEach :: set up cy.server() for tests
-> it :: several tests waiting for requests
```

But then we have to set up the server twice.

### Desired behavior:

Cypress should expose a way to tell `cy.server()` that we don't want to reset the server before each test or one way to tell that we want to preserve aliased routes.",enhancement

287391580,Elements hidden using clip / clip-path css properties pass as visible,"### Current behavior:
Elements hidden using the CSS `clip` / `clip-path` properties pass visibility check.

### Desired behavior:
Visibility checks should fail as the element isn't visible.

### How to reproduce:
Hide any element using CSS `clip` / `clip-path` properties and define a test to check if it's visible. Test passes.

#### Test code:
```html
<div style=""position: absolute;clip: rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);"">
    <a href=""#test"">clip</a>
</div>

<div style=""position: absolute;clip-path: polygon(0px 0px, 0px 0px, 0px 0px, 0px 0px);"">
    <a href=""#test"">clip-path</a>
</div>

  it('should not be visible', function () {
    cy.visit('127.0.0.1')

    cy.get('a').should('be', 'vivible')
  })
})
```

### Additional Info (images, stack traces, etc)
While clip is deprecated clip-path is not. Unfortunately however clip is still used and supported so for the time being at least I think it should make visibility checks fail.

286589966,"Aggregate stats ourselves, do not rely on mocha reporters","Currently we rely on the mocha reporter's `stats` object to return us the stats related to a single run. We use this when displaying the final results of a run.

This is problematic because it may differ on custom reporters (which are not consistent with the base reporter) and we also disagree with the mocha semantics for things like counting the number of `tests`.

Tests to mocha are actual **test runnables** that must reach their `test end` event to being counted. This means that failures occurring in `hooks` they do not increment this number - which makes no sense.

In Cypress we consider the test body itself and **all associated hooks** to be one discrete ""test"". In our UI we show tests failing on their hooks (and provide you visual indicators). 

Since we've already gone through all the trouble of making the UI represent this - it's necessary for us to aggregate the stats ourselves during a `cypress run` so we can accurately provide you the same stats (including for our Dashboard).

### Desired behavior:
**Ability to use updates in Chai 4.0:**
- Add `ordered` assertion: `to.have.ordered.members`
- Throw when non-existent property is read. `expect(true).to.be.ture; // Oops, typo, now Chai will throw an Error`
- Have suggestions on typos. `expect(false).to.be.fals; // Error: Invalid Chai property: fals. Did you mean ""false""?`
- Use `by` with `increase`, `change` `decrease`. `expect(increaseByTwo).to.increase(obj, 'val').by(2)`
- Use `does` and `but` as new no-op assertion.
- Use `nested` property

I am aware of the 'before' and 'after' but they only work per block, and therefor per file.

Right now i have like 10 files in my 'integration' folder, each handling a specific part of my website.
I have to write 10 times a 'before' and 'after' hook, but i can make 2 function and just call them 10 times (a call in the before and after hooks of each file)

The goal i am trying to achieve is to host my webapplication (the one i want to test) before i start cypress, and then unhost it again when i stop cypress...

i don't want to host my application 10 times and stop it 10 times, i just want to host it once, and stop it once..

What are your thoughts on this?
is this even the way to go? or should i do the hosting outside of my cypress environment?
the problem with most npm package is that they only host a site, but then block the thread. running it in parallel is an option, but then i can never 'unhost' the site...

And these CI providers: https://circleci.com/gh/cypress-io/cypress-test-tty and https://travis-ci.org/cypress-io/cypress-test-tty

Because we pipe the output of `stdout` and `stderr` when spawning the electron process from the CLI - this causes `process.stdout.isTTY` and `tty.isatty(1)` to be `false`.

Although this is *technically* true, since we are the ones controlling the piped process, we really want it to be have as a correctly ""inherited"" child process - which would then cause the checks for `tty` to be `true`.

This is important as terminal packages like `chalk` or `mocha` depend on this to figure out whether they should output colors, and additionally how to write things like new lines, etc.

- install TypeScript and [@bahmutov/add-typescript-to-cypress](https://github.com/bahmutov/add-typescript-to-cypress) - this will configure transpiling `.ts` files during testing
- when adding custom commands, add them to the `cy` global interface. TypeScript compiler is smart enough to merge your definitions with the `cy` type from `node_modules/cypress` module. For example

```ts
/**
 * Goes to google site
 */
function google() {
  return cy.visit('https://google.com');
}

Cypress.Commands.add('google', google);

declare namespace Cypress {
  interface Chainable<Subject> {
    google: typeof google;
  }
}
```
The only thing TypeScript cannot do - if one of your custom commands calls _another_ custom command, then `tsc` does not understand that the new command will be there. In other words this does not work and requires casting `cy` as `any` to work

```ts
function foo() {} // first custom command to be added
function bar() {
  cy.foo() // error: cy does not have method ""foo"" :(
}

Cypress.Commands.add('foo', foo);
Cypress.Commands.add('bar', bar);

declare namespace Cypress {
  interface Chainable<Subject> {
    foo: typeof foo;
    bar: typeof bar;
  }
}
```

In that case I suggest extracting custom `foo` command into plain function and not attaching it to the `cy` interface.",bug

I looked at the IntelliSense popups in the project https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-todomvc and the results are not very useful. While they could be useful (there is some formatting that I had to adjust on `cy.type` example to get this to work) like for `cy.type`

`cy.visit` is ok, but the example needs to be tweaked to be displayed properly. Here is what works

```
/**
 * Type into a DOM element.
 *
 * @see https://on.cypress.io/type
 * @example
 *
 *    // type ""Hello, World"" into the <input> element

- Operating System: Mac OS Sierra
- Cypress Version: 1.4.0
- Browser Version: Chrome 63.0.3239.108

### Is this a Feature or Bug?
Bug

### Current behavior:
Using the Cypress `type` function on a `contenteditable` input doesn't move the caret along with the text.  At first I thought this might be specific to React, but actually it does the same thing with a plain `contenteditable` input on any HTML page.


### Desired behavior:
To move the caret with the text so you can simulate typing and do things like `{enter}`

### How to reproduce:
1. Create a `contenteditable` html element
2. Use `type()` on that element

#### Test code:

```
<p contenteditable=""true"">
    Hello
</p>

cy.get('p').type('hello', {delay: 1000})
```

The delay is helpful so you can actually see the caret as it's being typed out.

- Operating System: Win10
- Cypress Version: 
- Browser Version: 

### Is this a Feature or Bug?
Bug

### Current behavior:
variables in Command callback are ignored when `{prevSubject: <options>}` exists
i.e.:
```js
Cypress.Commands.add('clickNavLink', { prevSubject: 'optional' }, (name) => {
  cy.get(`[data-test=""${name}-nav-link""]`).click()
});
```
`cy.clickNavLink('sales')` returns `GET [data-test=""undefined-home-tile""]`

but 
```js
Cypress.Commands.add('clickNavLink', (name) => {
  cy.get(`[data-test=""${name}-nav-link""]`).click()
});
```
`cy.clickNavLink('sales')` returns `GET [data-test=""sales-home-tile""]`

### Desired behavior:
variables in a callback are respected when `prevSubject` is present

### How to reproduce:
create a `Cypress.Command` with `prevSubject: 'optional'` variable and variable in callback.

#### Test code:
`./support/commands.js`
```js
Cypress.Commands.add('testClickNavLink', { prevSubject: 'optional' }, (name) => {
  cy.get(`a[href=""/commands/${name}""]`).click()
});
```
`./integration/test_example_links.js`
```js
describe('Run through traversal links', function() {
  beforeEach(() => cy.visit('https://example.cypress.io'));

  ['querying', 'traversal', 'actions'].forEach((n) => {
    it('fails', () => {
    cy.testClickNavLink(n);
    })
  })
});

```
I know the test will fail because there's multiple, but really you just need to see that it returns `undefined` instead of the variable passed into the callback.

I'll throw a repo together tonight if needed but this is pretty straightforward to test.

283008626,Possible type definition conflict on @types/chai,"The `package.json` uses `save-exact=true`. I didn't really notice this when I added type for Cypress-wrapped types, but it can causes issues if a type definition defined global variables (you can't duplicate global declarations). The issue I'm seeing is in `@types/chai`.

It looks like Cypress depends on `chai@^3.5.0` (Chai is at 4 now - looks like `nested` was added). A project could also use chai at a different version - normally not a problem as both `npm` and `yarn` will embed on conflict detection. But TypeScript won't handle this conflict as gracefully for type definitions. I guess there are a few options to fix this.

- dependency version could be any `*`
- dependency version could be some tested versions: `^3.5.0 || ^4.0.0`
- If using `yarn`, you can just override using a resolution: https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/selective-version-resolutions/
- Have the app remove `@types/chai` as a dependency

Either dependency version string change should prevent `yarn` or `npm` from detecting a conflict and flatten the dependency.

Personally I think handling `3.5+` is okay. I can open an issue later. There is a workaround (I'm using yarn, so it will allow resolution overrides).

282959883,async functions of tests can write the localStorage after it was cleared for the following test,"## Current behavior: 

Even so Cypress clears the `localStorage` before each test older tests can still have unresolved async functions (for example returning API calls) that write into the `localStorage` during the execution of the next test.

### How to reproduce:

see: Test Code (README.md)

#### Test code:

https://github.com/Aligertor/cypressTestLocalStorage

### Additional Info / Our real world problem

In our real scenario JS Application potentially does API calls after be loaded into the browser the first time. We set some `cy.route`'s to define the response of those calls, Therefore we have a set of commands defining different routes for different test cases.

In some of our test cases we now have to wait for these calls to resolve because some handlers will write into localStorage. 

Ideally we dont have to care about this.

If this is not possible at least there should be better support to use commands aka ""be able to use an alias of an route no matter where it was defined"" so people can take care of those timing issues by adding a `cy.wait` without guessing milliseconds

282053779,Cypress getting into an infinite XHR request loop,"### Current behavior:
When visiting a page on our site through Cypress we're seeing it never complete loading because something causes the XHR requests being made to be made infinitely.

If we look at the Cypress CLI output when running the test we see:

```
GET /xhr/item/alternate-colours/1606925 200 236.222 ms - -
GET /xhr/item/alternate-colours/1606925 200 456.960 ms - -
GET /xhr/item/alternate-colours/1606925 200 288.704 ms - -
GET /xhr/item/alternate-colours/1606925 200 260.936 ms - -
```

This request is only made by our application once; if I got to the page in a browser and watch the network tab I can see that the request is made once. Watching the test through the Cypress UI, I can see that the browser just hangs and becomes unresponsive as all these requests are firing.

I'm not sure what, but something is causing these requests to run again and again and again.

Interestingly, this only happens via `cypress open` and then running the test through the UI. If I do `cypress run` and watch the video, the test does complete and the XHR requests complete as expected.

I'm not sure what extra info is useful here but let me know what I can provide to help with this.

By passing through CSP, and possibly tweaking it, we should be able to add security testing to Cypress. 
- is my CSP setup correctly?
- are my violations reported?
- can I load code / style / object from given domain or will it throw an error?

## Observation

- if we run content security policy with report-only mode, everything is working and no problems are reported when running the test itself (and any inline scripts are executed, but reported)

using [helmet](https://helmetjs.github.io/docs/csp/) to generate CSP, we can do nothing and just run in report mode.

```js
// basically do not allow inline scripts
app.use(
  helmet.contentSecurityPolicy({
    directives: {
      scriptSrc: [""'self'""],
      reportUri: '/report-violation'
    },
    reportOnly: true
  })
)
```

```html

It would be great to be able to somehow get the full URL from these XHR lines, to visually confirm the order of events and to make it quick to set up cy.route(). Although I can open the Network tab of dev tools, there is a lot of activity going on there and no way to match it to the XHR entries in the test runner view. The test runner view is a better representation of the calls as they relate to the tests, and would be the ideal place to get these URLs from.

Feature

### Current behavior:
When running `npm install` with Cypress listed as a dependency, the binary is always downloaded, unzipped and installed.

### Desired behavior:
Provide a mechanism (most likely an environment variable such as `CYPRESS_SKIP_BINARY_INSTALL`) where the user can manually skip the binary install process.

### Impetus
We have a React project with Cypress tests that are run in our CI pipeline (currently Travis). We also have our project being built and deployed by a different service (currently Netlify). Cypress is not needed during the build/deploy process but is being installed anyway. This adds additional load and time to our build process.

### Test code:

278591452,Error not shown in the reporter when using `document.write`,"### Current behavior

If we load HTML page that throws a JS error, it is shown in the Cypress test reporter GUI. For example here is HTLM page

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title></title>
</head>
<body>
  example loaded
  <script>
    console.log('a message')
    throw new Error('from HTML')
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

When test just does simple 

```js
beforeEach(() => {
  cy.visit('index.html')
})

it('works', () => {})
```

Then the gui shows the error

But if we write the same page into test iframe ourselves, the error is swallowed

```js
// as as file ""index.html""
const html = `
<!DOCTYPE html>

I know this is kind of weird test case, but I accidentally discovered it when working on Codepen demo https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-recipes/tree/master/examples/blogs__codepen-demo when the page I was using was broken, and the tests just got blank screen

- Send Screenshots (or link)
- Send Video (or link)
- Analytics like...was this test failing before? the last time it passed?

```
so that in regression mode, I'll still allow the real endpoint to flow, but instead of seeding my database per each test, I can alter the response to suit the need of my feature under test.

What I tried was
```js
cy.route({
    method: 'POST',
    url: 'api/myEndpoint',
    onResponse: xhr => xhr.response.body.foo = 'bar'
})
```
which alters the xhr response when I'm clicking on the route and view the Logger, but this doesn't get passed into the response to be consumed.

and
```js
cy.route({
    method: 'POST',
    url: 'api/myEndpoint',
    response: {},
    onResponse: function(xhr) { this.response = {
        ...xhr,

### How to reproduce:


#### Test code:

### Additional Info (images, stack traces, etc)

This bug was introduced in [1.1.1](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog.html#1-1-1) with https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/930 as mentioned in [this comment](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/928#issuecomment-346369782).

Calling `.clear()` seems to call `.type()` with `{selectall}{del}` as per the following snippet. This string is 16 characters long and takes into account the `maxlength` attribute (while it should not).

https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/cb67a5ace3a9ff8d6bb7b5d93f06048dd3469ec5/packages/driver/src/cy/commands/actions/type.coffee#L402

The changes introduced in 1.1.1 slice the characters to respect the `maxlength` attribute value, therefore slicing these tokens. This is why a maxlength from 1 to 15 causes this bug.

I guess not counting tokens in the characters count is probably the way to go. Pseudo code could look like:

```js
const tokens = RegExp(Object.keys(keyStandardMap).join('|'), 'g')
chars.replace(tokens, '')

275995241,In-browser file download support,"## Current behavior:
In Electron, when an anchor is clicked that downloads a file from the server, a ""Save"" dialog is shown  thus preventing the rest of the test case from completing / succeeding. No dialog is shown in Chrome, at least currently, but this appears to be just because that's Chrome's default behaviour.

Furthermore, there is no way of specifying the desired location of file downloads.

### Desired behavior:

1. No ""Save"" dialog should be ever shown.
2. Not as crucial (i.e. with rather easy workaround in the CI), but we should be able to configure browser (both Chrome and Electron, and any browsers supported in the future) with the location where files should be downloaded. 

This should work both for files downloaded from the server (with `Content-Disposition` HTTP header), as well as for files downloaded using in-browser `Blob` + dynamically generated anchor approach.

### How to reproduce:

Given any site that contains an `<a href="""">...</a>` pointing to a file served with `Content-Disposition` header, use a test script similar to the one posted below:

#### Test code:

```js
describe('Lorem', function() {
  it('Ipsum', function() {
    cy.visit(""https://localhost"")
      .get(""a.download-link"").click()
      // This blocks in Electron because of the ""Save"" popup.
      .readFile(""/Users/kls/Downloads/file.txt"")
      .then(function() {
         // Do something with the file.
      });
  })
})
```

### Additional Info (images, stack traces, etc)

This functionality is needed in cases where it is not possible to verify validity of the download using [other methods suggested in the FAQ](https://docs.cypress.io/faq/questions/using-cypress-faq.html#Is-there-a-way-to-test-that-a-file-got-downloaded-I-want-to-test-that-a-button-click-triggers-a-download):

- When downloaded file is dynamically generated on the server based on a data that browser sends over to it, in case when this data is sensitive and cannot be sent over in the file URL. Imagine a file path such as `https://bank/transaction-history/34964483209802/pdf`, where `34964483209802` is a credit card number. This is unacceptable from the security / compliance perspective, because HTTP URL's are oftentimes logged in proxies or web servers. One solution is to send sensitive data over secure comms, i.e. WebSockets, just after user clicks the anchor. But this makes it impossible to just look at URL and issue `cy.request()`.

269784913,cy.drag() & cy.mouse proposal,"As mention in the #845 it would be interesting to have a broader API for drag'n drop and mouse movement.

### Desired behavior

It's very hard to reproduce drag'n drop using native browser events. It's much simpler to simulate how the mouse would behave. Here is a drag'n drop assertion done on nightwatch.js

```js
    let elementToMove = '//div[@class=""column""][2]'
    browser
      .url('http://grafikart.github.io/ReorderJS/index.html')
      .useXpath()
      .waitForElementVisible(elementToMove, 1000)
      .moveToElement(elementToMove, 10, 10)
      .mouseButtonDown(0)
      .moveToElement('//div[@class=""column""][1]', 10, 10)
      .mouseButtonUp(0)
```

The API behaves at a lower level where we can control how the mouse behave. It would be nice to have something to describe generic behaviours.

```js
cy.drag(selector: string, position: topLeft|center|topRight...., x: number, y: number)
cy.drag(selector: string, x: number, y: number)
// Maybe
cy.drag(fromSelector: string, toSelector: string) 

// Or a low level api to control the mouse
cy.mouse.moveTo(selector: string)
cy.mouse.press(button = 0)
cy.mouse.moveTo(selector: string)
cy.mouse.release()

269405749,Move the cursor (Drag and Drop),"I read the issue #386 but triggering the JavaScript events seem a bit complicated in some situation (when you don't know the underlying code).

### Use case

My goal is to assert a drag'n drop sorting library work as expected : http://grafikart.github.io/ReorderJS/index.html

### Current behavior:

I can make my test pass with the **electron** browser but it will fail on **chrome** (nothing moves)

```js
      cy.visit('http://grafikart.github.io/ReorderJS/index.html')
      cy.get('.column:eq(3)').as('toMove')
      cy.get('@toMove')
            .should('attr', 'data-position', '2')
            .trigger('mousedown')
      cy.get('.column:eq(2)').trigger('mousemove')
      cy.get('@toMove')
           .trigger('mouseup')
           .should('attr', 'data-position', '1')
```

### How to reproduce:

You can produce a passing test on electron that fails on chrome with this simplified test (default resolution not changed : 1000 x 660)

```js
    it('Should sort', function () {

When working inside this repo we can start the server (the Cypress app itself) without building the binary. This is great of course, no need to build Electron binary, which saves a LOT of time.

```
npm start

But this is different from the way it runs in user projects, where the execution goes through the CLI first (`cli/bin/cypress` script)

Thus small differences in parsing CLI arguments are hard to catch. For example, server had `--group` and `--group-id` support for a while, but CLI did not allow these options until #836 

## proposal

CLI should detect when it is inside the monorepo and there is no Cypress app in the `dist` subfolder.

```js
describe('Example', () => {

  Cypress.Cookies.defaults({
    whitelist: /SESSION_COOKIE/
  });

  before('we should log in first', () => {
    cy
      // clearCookies() does not clear whitelisted cookies
      .clearCookies()
      .visit('application_url, which sets a NEW SESSION_COOKIE to use throughout the following tests');

    cy
      .visit('application_url/subpage')
      .wait(5000);

    // More and more tests.
    cy
      .visit('application_url/subpage')
      .wait(5000);
  });
});
```

In the current phase my tests keeps failing, because the first run logs in and because I preserve the cookie, it is persisted throughout every test that runs.

Technically I'm not able to clear cookies between runs/during tests.


### Desired behavior:
Few suggestions :)
- clearCookies() should be able to remove all cookies, even whitelisted cookies (to avoid a breaking change, it can be an option to clearCookies(), e.g. clearWhitelisted: true ?)
- Next to 'preserveOnce()' I'd also rather see a 'preserve' that will at least preserve the cookies throughout the test suite (test suite = 1 file). If I want to achieve what I actually want right now I have to call preserveOnce() in every single test.

### How to reproduce:
Use the above code, start coding on the test and press Save. Cypress will run the test, but preserve the whitelisted cookie even though it says 'clearCookies()'. Also when you use the 'Run all tests'. 

#### Test code:

268399737,Improve invoking native DOM methods,"### Current behavior:

Cypress makes invoking methods *on native DOM elements* less expressive than it could be.

My use case: I want to call an `<input>`'s `checkValidity` method. According to [the FAQ](https://docs.cypress.io/faq/questions/using-cypress-faq.html#How-do-I-get-the-native-DOM-reference-of-an-element-found-using-Cypress) I basically need to do this:

```javascript
cy.get('input')
  .should($input => {
    expect($input.get(0).checkValidity()).not.to.equal(false)
  })
```
This basically works, but Cypress' otherwise amazing expressivity takes a hard hit here since the logs naturally don't know anything about the invocation:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1922624/32000400-da787ef4-b996-11e7-9b79-45c087098bbc.png)

→ The assertion is shown, however the desired behaviour would be to also have the invocation listed in the log, as it does when running `.invoke()`.

### Desired behavior:
I'd like to advocate for a built-in way to invoke native DOM methods. Some quick thinking lead me to two possible solutions:

**The obvious one.** Provide an `.invokeNative()` method on the Cypress wrapper. However having two methods for basically the same thing may not be desirable.

**The embracing-jQuery one.** Extend the built-in jQuery copy with a `native` method that proxies native DOM calls. I've tried this myself, but you apparently have shielded the `Cypress.$.fn` away from curious developers. 🙃 

The implementation would basically be this:

```javascript
Cypress.$.fn.native = (method, ...args) => {
  return this.get(0)[method](...args)
}
```

which would allow to invoke native DOM functionality as easy as:

```javascript
cy.get('input')
  .invoke('native', 'checkValidity')
  .should('not.equal', false)
```

I'd love to hear your feedback on this.

268205914,Parse domains/subdomains/tld using public suffix,"Currently Cypress does a naive attempt at determining the domain, subdomain, and TLD of the current application under test.

It does not consider the public suffix, which results in it setting incorrect `document.domain` as well as yelling about changing domains when it's really not.

We should package in this [npm module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/psl) and then either make calls for parsing async (and do it in node) or transfer the data to Cypress during its bootstrap phase so it can parse it in the driver correctly.

Cypress runs extremely slowly. Run time for 2 tiny tests is ~60-65 compared to similar Protractor test suite which takes ~20-25 seconds to complete the same tests. My timing for Cypress is based on the timer in the runner and my timing for Protractor is based on the timestamp in the console from when it starts and finishes.

### Desired behavior:
Significant improvement to run time.

Comparable Protractor code:
```js
describe('Attempt to log in', () => {
    const EC = protractor.ExpectedConditions;

    beforeAll(() => {
        browser.get('/');
        browser.wait(EC.presenceOf($('#username')), 15000);
    });

    it('without a username or password', () => {
        element(by.buttonText('SIGN IN').click();

    it('without a password', () => {

266728817,Proposal: add snapshot testing (this is not screenshot diffing),"Similar to Jest / Ava snapshot testing (see https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/snapshot-testing/ and https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/picking-snapshot-library/) it would be nice to save / compare values to snapshots.

For example this test can save the wrapped objects on the first run, then we would check in the generated `snapshots.js` file. Next time Cypress runs it would compare new values with saved snapshots and throw an error if they are different.

Here is a proof of concept

```js
describe('my tests', () => {
  it('works', () => {
    cy.log('first snapshot')
    cy.wrap({foo: 42}).snapshot()

    cy.log('second snapshot')
    cy.wrap({bar: 101}).snapshot()
  })
})
```

When clicking on ""snapshot"" in the reporter, it shows the object in the dev tools

Similarly, if previous command yields a jQuery element, then it is converted into JSON and saved. For example, we could snapshot focused element before and after typing (TodoMVC example at todomvc.com/examples/react/)

```js
describe('focused input field', () => {
  it('is empty and then typed into', () => {
    cy.visit('http://todomvc.com/examples/react/')
    cy.focused()
      .snapshot('initial') // given human names as well
      .type('eat healthy breakfast')
      .snapshot('after typing')
  })
})
```
When clicking on the snapshot in this case, prints original element and JSON object

![screen shot 2017-10-19 at 1 53 07 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2212006/31756261-219ee852-b471-11e7-93d3-44a326d1db28.png)

The snapshots are all loaded at the start and saved together at the end. Here is snapshot file
```js
module.exports = {
  ""my tests"": {
    ""works"": {
      ""1"": {
        ""foo"": 42
      },
      ""2"": {
        ""bar"": 101
      }
    }
  },
  ""focused input field"": {
    ""is empty and then typed into"": {
      ""initial"": {
        ""tagName"": ""input"",
        ""attributes"": {
          ""class"": ""new-todo"",
          ""placeholder"": ""What needs to be done?"",
          ""value"": """"
        }
      },
      ""after typing"": {
        ""tagName"": ""input"",
        ""attributes"": {
          ""class"": ""new-todo"",

        }
      }
    }
  },
  ""__version"": ""1.0.2""
}
```

If a run time value during test does not match value loaded from snapshot, it throws an exception.

I'm encountering some flaky tests due to an element not being considered visible by Cypress, I don't understand what makes an element visible or not visible by Cypress and was hoping someone could clarify it for me.

Since version 0.20 tests randomly decide to fail with this message: `This element '<a.sc-cqpYsc.cmkxre>' is not visible because it has an effective width and height of: '0 x 0' pixels.`.
However, when I inspect it is definitely has a size bigger then 0 by 0, as you can see in the screenshots.

260034227,Full Network Layer Stubbing / fetch support,"Pull Request (in progress): https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/4176

## What users want
* To be able to stub any kind of HTTP request including `window.fetch` 
  * note: temporary polyfill available https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7710 [v4.9.0](https://on.cypress.io/changelog#4-9-0)
* To blacklist certain domains (google analytics, new relic, intercom)
* To have more control over dynamically routing / stubbing requests and responses
* To more easily stub graphQL calls

## What we do now
* We modify the host `XMLHttpRequest` object which limits us to only stubbing XHR's from the main application frame.

## What we need to do
* Throw away the entire existing system for stubbing
* Move stubbing into the internal Cypress network proxy layer (outside of the browser)
* Synchronize the state of the browser tests with the backend (so its aware what needs to be stubbed / routed)
* Remove `cy.server` and instead just use `cy.route`
* Expand the API's for more advanced configuration
* Accept `blacklistDomains` option for `cypress.json`
* As each request comes in, if we expose callback functions we'll need to constantly communicate with the driver for guidance on what to do - whether to proceed - halt, etc. This can get pretty complicated and might have significant performance issues. We'll need to experiment ~~and we may not be able to provide callback functions anymore.~~

## Things to consider
* `onRequest` and `onResponse` currently provide the raw level `xhr` object. This would no longer be possible. We'd have to serialize the request / response into basic objects. No method calling would be available.
* The `onError` callback could no longer exist
* Additionally we hook into the `onerror` events for XHR's and will automatically fail the test if this is called. This would no longer be possible.
* Blacklisting `https` cannot be dynamic. It would have to be set in `cypress.json` or environment variables. The reason is that for each blacklisted domain that goes over https, we would have to route that traffic to a self signed certificate. Browser freak out if traffic to https gets assigned one certificate, and then within the same session it gets another cert applied. What this means is that before spawning the browser we have to isolate that traffic and know ahead of time not to route it to the actual server. This enables us to send a single cert to the browser.
* We could enable non https hosts to be dynamically blacklisted, but these API's would be async and likely difficult for users to understand / use. We might be able to bake these into `cy.route` but I'm not sure there's much of a use case here of only dynamically blacklisting non https traffic.
* We will no longer be able to tell the difference between an `XHR` and any other kind of `http` request. We'd likely have to change the page events to say `REQ` and `REQ STUB` instead of `XHR` and `XHR STUB`.
* It would be very difficult to provide accurate `onResponse` callback functions. It's possible for the internal server to know when an HTTP request has been completed, but it's not possible to know whether the browser has actually finished processing it. This may or may not be a problem.
* How would we handle stubbing binary / streaming responses?
* How would we handle stubbing things like images? (This is likely pretty simple)

## Bonus Points
* It would likely be possible to stub Websocket traffic in the same manner
* The problem with this is that most Websocket libraries (ie socket.io) add their own ""encoding"" pattern on top of each websocket message frame. The ergonomics around stubbing this would be odd. The problem is this is library (and even version of library) specific. This may be a better use case for `cy.stub`, or perhaps a 3rd party extension

",enhancement
260033528,Create a Plugins / Extensions API,"## The idea behind this
As it stands - while users can create custom commands in the `driver`, we do not expose any real way to alter, modify or change Cypress's behavior **BEHIND** the driver (in the node server code).

Currently all we expose is a simple `cypress.json` to change the way Cypress works. This is heavily limiting.

What we need to do is expose a public interface so users can write `node` code to modify and alter the internals.

The use cases we're specifically trying to support are:

#### Custom Preprocessors
Swapping out the default `preprocessor` for custom ones. This is the thing that processes the spec files and ultimately serves them to the browser.

Customizing the preprocess would enable users to write `typescript`, `coffeescript 2.0`, `clojurescript`, use `webpack`, customize `babel` options, use newer `ES7` features, etc, etc. Big win.

#### Browser Configuration
Users would have access to the browser processes and launch configuration. This would enable them to change the flags used to launch browsers.

You could also use this to load in browser extensions.

#### Browser Finding
Changes / modifies the logic we use to find browsers on the system.

#### Custom Configuration
Having just a single `cypress.json` is limiting. Users have expressed a desire to have more programatic control over things like environment variables. 

#### Backend Messaging
While we currently expose `cy.exec` and `cy.request`, there is still a desire to message / talk directly to your backend.

Exposing this API would enable you to do things like call your application code directly to do things like setup / seed / create / update database records.

#### Screenshot Diffing
As we continue to expand the features of Cypress we would expand these API's to do things like letting you swap out the screenshot diffing algorithm.

## The Cypress Ecosystem
Going down this route will enable us to develop a Cypress Ecosystem consisting of official extensions (created by us) as well as user submitted extensions.

We'll also need to create an ""index"" of extensions that enable users to search, browse, and submit new extensions.

## Things to consider
- How will we / users handle versioning for plugins? We may need to set a `process.versions.cypress`
- How will we differentiate official plugins from regular ones? We could publish them under our `@cypress` npm namespace.
- How will we make modifying the **default** plugin that Cypress uses by default. Users may want to swap out entire implementations (like the preprocessor) or perhaps just modify the configuration for the default one.
- We should likely seed a commented out `cypress/plugins/index.js` with all of the API's that we support. 
- We should enable users to easily debug their `node` code by passing a flag to Cypress which spawns the internal chrome inspector.
- Users code will run in the builtin `node` environment that comes with Cypress.

## Examples of how we could do this

```js
// cypress/plugins/index.js

module.exports = ((register, config, utils, defaults) => {
  register('on:spec:file:preprocessor', (filePath, options) => {

259846726,Scrolling element in the viewport when clicking on step in reporter is too agressive,"Applies to all versions of Cypress

Imagine simple test with two steps:
- get parent element
- find child element

When we click on the second step in the reporter (on the left), it scrolls so aggressively, that it puts the top edge of the child element at the top of the viewport. Thus the parent element is now invisible. Think submit button and the form around it - I would like to still see the form when clicking on the submit button step.

Here is an example. First element is a demo div with some graphics and ""Next step"" button. At first I see the demo div and plan to click on the ""next step"" in the reporter

The ""next step"" button element is *already visible*, but when I click on the reporter, it scrolls it way up, hiding the demo block it is inside of. And since the ""next step"" button changes the appearance of the demo block, I do not see right away how it changed it.

A better solution for scrolling would be
- if the element is already fully visible in the viewport when clicking do not scroll
- otherwise scroll
    - scrolling so that the element is in the middle of the viewport is best

259623204,"Proposal: enable spec globbing, enforce isolated renderer processes for each spec","## What users want
- To be able to run multiple specs files

## How we could do this
- Add glob support to `cypress run`
- `cypress run --spec cypress/integration/login/**/*`

Doesn't sound that hard, but there are many potential areas this will affect.

## What I'm proposing
- Enable multiple specs, but force each spec to run in its own isolated renderer process

## Why is this necessary?

### The default behavior is bad
As of today, we automatically ""merge"" and group multiple spec files by using a magical route called: `__all`.

This means that when you iterate on the spec itself: it's isolated because it's the only spec file served. But when you run them all together, they are no longer isolated. This can cause unforeseen issues to arise when running all the specs together which are difficult if not impossible to reproduce.

### Users don't use the Test Runner and the CLI as intended

We constantly see users running all their specs from the Test Runner. 

The Test Runner is not designed for this use case. It's designed to run a single or handful of specs at a time as you iterate and build your tests. The Test Runner is specialized for **debuggability** while the CLI is designed for running all of your tests. 

When the Test Runner runs, it's constantly creating snapshots, holding references in memory, etc. These quickly add up and your tests end up going slower and slower and oftentimes crash the entire renderer process. This is a design decision, not a bug. When running from the Test Runner it's specialized to enable users to interact with the tests' commands. Running from the Test Runner never ""ends"" or exits. 

This is much different than the CLI. Running from the CLI prevents you from interacting with anything. The CLI will run ""to completion"" and exit whereas the Test Runner never actually ends. Because of these differences, when running from the CLI, Cypress makes several internal performance optimizations to prevent memory exhaustion and to run as fast as possible.

### Watch mode is disabled automatically on 'All Tests'

Users expect ""Run All Tests"" to reload when you change a spec file. File watching is a CPU intensive task and because we've had users write hundreds of spec files, decided not to always do this. This goes back to the theory that you shouldn't be using this mode to run all your tests.

### Solving the Test Runner problem

One possible solution is to count the number of tests you're running in the Test Runner and automatically disable the built in debuggability features and to run the same way the CLI does. We'd need to show a warning message to the user indicating we're ""switching off"" these features and you won't be able to interact with any of the tests. 

This may be pretty annoying but at least it will communicate the intent of the Test Runner well. This option could be exposed via `cypress.json` such as `{ interactabilityThreshold: 5 }`. Users could then set this really high or disable it to get the old functionality back.

## The Downsides

### Running All the Tests

By enforcing specs to run in their own isolated process, we instantly have a huge problem for the Test Runner. 

For instance there is a:

- 'Run All Tests' button
- A seeded `example_spec` that contains **wayyyyy** too many tests and does not represent a normal use case.

This could be solved by removing the `Run All Tests` button but users would likely complain about this and it's unexpected. 

> Why can every other testing tool run all tests but Cypress can't?

The `example_spec` could be solved by splitting up the [kitchen sink tests](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-kitchensink) into a series of files:

- `querying_spec`
- `stubbing_spec`
- `network_spec`
- etc, etc, etc

Splitting up the `example_spec` into smaller files is an easy win: but then we're back to the problem above: ""How do I run all my tests?""

We could kick the can on this, and continue to let users run all of their tests from the Test Runner. Unfortunately, if we introduce a ""warning message"" this would continue to communicate confusing intent.

> Why is it warning me like I'm doing something wrong when all I've done is click the first button I've seen!

Another option is when running ""All Tests"" from the Test Runner we iterate and highlight each spec but then kill the process when switching to the new spec. This kind of defeats the purpose of the GUI as you would not be able to interact (and failures would instantly go away). Not a good option.

## The Upsides (why this would help all users)

Forcing each spec to run in its own isolated renderer would do a few very important things:

- It would prevent any global leakage from one spec to the next
- It would automatically restart the browser / renderer process in between each spec
- Memory would automatically be purged and we'd never have to worry about memory leaks
- The browser would likely crash much less often
- This positions users to better maintain and manage a growing suite of tests
- Introducing parallelization and load balancing becomes painlessly simple
- Users would overall see more consistent test results

### Parallelization

Forcing specs to run isolated is actually the same thing as performing parallelizations by spinning up multiple docker containers or instances and then dividing all of the spec files between them.

When this happens you still have all the same problems as what we listed above:

- You will need to stitch together multiple external reports
- You will receive multiple isolated videos
- You will receive multiple `stdout` text

Because users are already doing this (manually) it means they're overcoming these problems, or they aren't really problems to begin with - which is why I'm okay with making this the default behavior.

This problem is further mitigated by the way the Dashboard Service works. It can automatically associate groups of independent specs to the same run. This means all the data will be aggregated in the same place making it appear as if the run happened on a single machine.

### Load Balancing

Splitting up the specs enables us to easily load balance parallelization.

Instead of manually balancing by machine like this:

- Machine A gets Spec 1,2,3
- Machine B gets Spec 4,5
- Machine C gets Spec 6,7,8,9
- Machine D gets Spec 10,11

Each machine would run at the same time and simply ask ""for the next spec file"".

That means the work completes as fast as possible without needing to manually balance or tweak anything.

Load balancing is something our Dashboard Service is already doing on internal projects.

### Failure Isolation

Another benefit is that by splitting up the specs and taking multiple videos, you have a much easier time focusing on the real thing you care about - failures.

Instead of having a 30+min run, your videos would only be the duration of each spec file. Much better and easier to work with.

### More consistent results

Splitting out spec files will absolutely without a doubt yield better, more consistent results. Browsers aren't perfect and Cypress pushes them to their absolute limit. Garbage collection does not work in our favor - letting the browser decide when to GC oftentimes leads it to eating up huge chunks of ""primed"" memory and there is no way to force it to release.

We've been internally running in isolated specs (oftentimes thousands of specs across dozens of files) and it has removed nearly all flake. Previously this flake only cropped up when running all the specs at once and it was incredibly difficult to default and took a huge amount of effort.

### Better video names

Videos would no longer have a random name. Instead they could be named after the spec file: `cypress/videos/login_spec.js.mp4`

## New Challenges

The default `spec` reporter and the additional Cypress messages would run for as many N specs you have. Instead of receiving a single ""report"" Cypress would essentially iterate through each spec file and start the ""Tests Running"" message all the way through to ""Tests Finished"". Internally we'd keep state with the number of failures and still exit with the total aggregate. 

### External Reporters

This would unfortunately create a problem for external / 3rd party reporters. Instead of receiving a single report, it would generate a report for each spec file. While this sounds bad it's not that different than what already happens when you parallelize a run.",enhancement

259271746,Print reasons why Cypress considers an element 'visible' in errors.,"### Is this a Feature or Bug?
Feature

### Current behavior:
When I assert that an element `.should('not.be.visible')`, but Cypress finds that it is visible, it doesn't tell me why it considered the element visible.

**Error: why does Cypress think it's visible??**
![screen shot 2017-09-20 at 3 10 24 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1271364/30662663-e069d9f8-9e15-11e7-9096-96bbf4b100c6.png)

### Desired behavior:
Cypress should explicitly print the reasons for why Cypress considers an element 'visible' when it fails `.should('not.be.visible')` assertion (just as it does for when it fails `.should('be.visible')`).

My specific use case had to do with an element on my page having a style of `{opacity: 0}`. So, to me, the element seems to not be visible and I expected a `.should('not.be.visible')` assertion to pass. 

After speaking with the Cypress team, the current behavior is **correct** however. Since the browser actually allows users to interact with elements that have `{opacity:0}` and Cypress uses this visibility algorithm to determine if elements are intractable, they do not intend to change this behavior.

The list of reasons for why Cypress considers something visible may have a specific message about opacity listed first?

### How to reproduce:
```js
cy.get('.el-with-opacity-zero').should('not.be.visible')
```

## Reasons why an element is considered not visible

### Is this a Feature or Bug?
Bug

### Current behavior:
If an error is raised in both the `beforeEach` and `afterEach` hooks for tests, Cypress will not stop the test run and seems to continue recording video indefinitely (video file keeps increasing).

### Desired behavior:
Tests should fail with a descriptive error message.

### How to reproduce:
Run the test below.

`node_modules/.bin/cypress run` will ""hang"" and continue running until killed
`node_modules/.bin/cypress run --headed` will also ""hang"", but you can see the errors in the log and see the timer continuing to run.

#### Test code:
```js
describe(""cypress"", function() {
  beforeEach(function() {
    // cy.visit(""/"");
    throw new Error();
  });

  afterEach(function() {
    // Commenting this out will allow the test to finish and stop recording
    // cy.visit(""/"");
    throw new Error();
  });

  it(""doesn't hang when both beforeEach and afterEach fail"", function() {
  });
});
```

### Additional Info (images, stack traces, etc)
- The original test makes a `cy.visit` call and the tests would hang if the server didn't respond with a 200.
- Canceling the `--headed` run results in output similar to the following:
```
  cypress
    1) ""before each"" hook for ""doesn't hang when both beforeEach and afterEach fail""

  0 passing (15s)
  1 failing

React (and other frameworks) keep the value of an input in sync by overwriting the `value` sett on `HTMLInputElement`.

The problem is that when using native events, the browser modifies the value under the hood without it touching the overridden `value` setter.

- Cypress Version: 0.20.0

### Is this a Feature or Bug?
Bug

### Current behavior:
Due to the new fix related to elements within parents with overflow properties, some elements that are clearly visible on the screen make the test fail when asserting should('be.visible')

### Desired behavior:
Identify whether or not the element is actually on screen, so the test only fails when it's not

### How to reproduce:
As for now, I can't make any test pass that checks the visibility of an element that is within a parent with any overflow property. That should be enough to reproduce.

250826980,Commands will retry and potentially exceed their timeout values during page transition,"- Cypress Version: 0.19.4

### Is this a Feature or Bug?
Bug

### Current behavior:
If a page transition event occurs whilst a command is currently running + retrying, it will continue to retry during this phase and not only can it unexpected time out, but it can also potentially access properties on the `window` or `document` that can cause DOMException errors.

### Desired behavior:
When Cypress detects a page transition it will pause executing new commands until page stability has been reached.

However currently running commands should have their retry behavior blocked and their internal retry counter reset once page transition is finished and page stability has resumed.

### How to reproduce:

```js
// if the click event on the <a> is async
// then the page transition event will occur
// once the cy.url command begins running

$(""a"").on(""click"", () => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    window.location.href = ""/new-page""

244933901,Internal timers are inaccurate / busted due to Electron,"- Cypress Version: 0.19.4

### Is this a Feature or Bug?
Bug

### Current behavior:
Timers when running in electron are busted due to https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/7079

This manifests itself in several ways:
- oftentimes during a hard refresh the Cypress UI will hang / block for several seconds while the underlying socket connection is being made
- tests will not re-run on file change due to timer polling problems
- using options like `delay` with `cy.route` can provide inaccurate delays which can lead to failing tests

### Desired behavior:
Timers should ""just work correctly""

244806100,scrolling elements should factor in position: sticky and multiple covered elements,"- Cypress Version: 0.19.4
- Browser Version:

### Is this a Feature or Bug?
Bug

Originally seen here: #565

### Current behavior:
- Cypress will not scroll beyond a single fixed position element when its covering up the desired element
- Cypress does not factor in `position: sticky` for elements covering up the desired element

### Desired behavior:
- Factor in multiple elements
- Factor in `position: sticky` elements

### Additional Info (images, stack traces, etc)

Cypress scrolls past the fixed header but not beyond that. This is the problem:

244802392,When waiting for actionability Cypress should scroll all parent containers not just window,"- Cypress Version: 0.19.4

### Is this a Feature or Bug?
Bug

### Current behavior:
When Cypress detects an element is covered by a fixed position element, it only attempts to scroll the window instead of the parent container(s).

### Desired behavior:
It's possible the window is not actually scrollable.

Cypress should iteratively scroll each parent container, starting with the window and working its way down until the element becomes actionable.

### Additional Info (images, stack traces, etc)

It does this currently, which means it's still covered up.

244358733,.type() misbehaves when input's value is changed programatically,"- Operating System:
Mac OS X 10.11.6

- Cypress Version:
0.19.4

- Browser Version:
Canary 61

### Is this a Feature or Bug?
I think it's a bug. It's possible I'm just not simulating a tab key in a way that lets Cypress pick caret position up, though.

### Current behavior:
When, for the `<input>`, I simulate pressing a tab key, and then type into the field, and then do it again, `.type()` will not append a text at the end of the input value, but in the middle.

Test scenario pasted below fails with the following error:

> AssertionError: expected '<input>' to have value 'autocomplete123autocomplete456autocomplete', but the value was 'autocomplete456123autocompleteautocomplete'

### Desired behavior:
I would expect `.type()` to always insert a text at the end of the input (or maybe, more generally, wherever the caret is).

### How to reproduce:
Serve this file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta http-equiv=""Content-Type"" content=""text/html; charset=UTF-8"">
  </head>
  <body>
    <input>

    <script>
      var input = document.querySelector(""input"");

      input.addEventListener(""keydown"", function(evt) {
      	if (evt.key === ""Tab"") {
          evt.preventDefault();
          input.value += ""autocomplete"";
        }
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Then execute test.

#### Test code:

```js
describe(""Quirk"", () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    cy.visit(""http://localhost:8000/cypress-type-quirk.html"");
  });

  Cypress.addChildCommand(""tab"", ($subj) => {
    let eDown = new KeyboardEvent(""keydown"", {key: ""Tab"", bubbles: true});
    $subj[0].dispatchEvent(eDown);

    let log = Cypress.Log.command({name: ""tab""});

    cy.chain()
      .wrap($subj, {log: false})
      .then(() => log.snapshot().end());
  });

  it(""misbehaves"", () => {
    cy
      .get(""input"")
        .tab().should(""have.value"", ""autocomplete"")
        .type(""123"").tab().should(""have.value"", ""autocomplete123autocomplete"")
        // This one fails.
        .type(""456"").tab().should(""have.value"", ""autocomplete123autocomplete456autocomplete"")
  });
});
```

### Additional Info (images, stack traces, etc)

Just to be clear: at the last step, input actually has an invalid value `""autocomplete456123autocompleteautocomplete""` - I can see it in the browser window.

Also, the caret (the blinking text cursor) disappears after `.type(""456"")` is invoked. Not sure how it relates to the issue though.

Here's a screencast of this happening: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_Kr8lR7GpI6VDVPeHB4SWQzZm8",bug
244147151,Add `keystrokeDelay` configuration option,"Currently Cypress uses a `setTimeout` between keystrokes to mimic how a user would press each key.

## Concern 1:
We should enable this property to be globally configurable such as `keystrokeDelay`.

## Concern 2:
When set to `false` or `0`, instead of making each key press be async, we should make it synchronous. This would be helpful to not only type faster but could make things easier for 3rd party JS frameworks such as react.

Currently as it stands since keypresses as async - its indeterminate whether or not your JS framework has finished 'processing' all of the keystrokes. For instance it may fire its change events while typing vs after all characters have been typed. See issue #534 for more detail.

## Concern 3:
When typing very long sequences its often useful just to have it all ""type at once"" and not have to wait. Give developers the choice to decide.

## Recommendation
- set `keystrokeDelay` to `true` by default (which is the minimum `setImmediate` async between key presses)
- if `keystrokeDelay` is set to `false` or `0` typing all characters synchronously
- if `keystrokeDelay` is set to a number then use this as the `setTimeout` value

Passing the `delay` option to `cy.type()` will override anything globally set in config.

- Cypress Version:
0.19.4

- Browser Version:
Canary 61

### Is this a Feature or Bug?
Bug

### Current behavior:
When attempting to click a first (or any other I think) element in the table, Cypress would start to scroll it up and down until a timeout happens. Error message is:

> CypressError: Timed out retrying: cy.click() failed because this element is being covered by another element:
> 
> &lt;div style=""position: sticky; top: 60px; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 36px; z-index: 10; background-color: tomato;"">&lt;/div>

### Desired behavior:

First row just gets clicked. Table is positioned correctly from the start and no scrolling/flickering happens.

### How to reproduce:

Save this file:

                            <tr>
                                <td>1</td>
                                <td>2</td>
                                <td>3</td>
                                <td>4</td>
                            </tr>
                            <!-- many more rows here -->

            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

</html>
```

Just maybe add many more rows, I truncated those for readability. Or use a file I host on Google Drive (link below).

Then serve it:

```bash
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Finally, run test:

#### Test code:

```js
describe(""Quirk."", () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    cy
      .visit(""http://localhost:8000/cypress-quirk.htm"")
      .get(""#app > div > div > div > table > tbody > tr:first-child"")
      // Using force: true fixes this test.
      .click({force: false});
  });

  it(""blah"", () => {
    // Nothing, cypress never gets to this point anyway.
  });
});
```

### Additional Info (images, stack traces, etc)

Video of the behaviour, as well as test HTML file that fails, are here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_Kr8lR7GpI6NFM0ajNwNnd6OGM

Also note that using `{force: true}` fixes this. Not sure why I need that though - first row should never be covered by another element, and in fact it isn't when I open the file in regular Chrome Canary. I verifed that using screenshot captures on ""performance"" tab in dev tools - first row appears well below the positioned `div`'s right from the start, there's no flickering there.",bug

241771011,Assertion chaining should never change the subject,"Because Cypress follows the underlying rules of the assertion engine, we automatically follow subject changes in assertions.

This leads to extremely confusing behavior and causes you to have to rewrite assertions awkwardly.

When failures due to this happen they fail in deep chai / assertion code and so the stack traces are very confusing.

## Current Behavior
```js
cy
  .get('a')
  .should('have.prop', 'href', '/foo')
  .and('have.class', 'active') // fails because subject is now a string
```

## Proposed Behavior
```js
cy
  .get('a')
  .should('have.prop', 'href', '/foo')
  .and('have.class', 'active') // passes, subject is unchanged
```

When you do want to chain off of an existing subject you can simply use an assertion callback function and explicitly pass in the subject.

```js
cy.get('a').should(($a) => {
  expect($a).to.have.prop('href').and.match(/foo/) // continues to work naturally in chai

For example, the command `mocha spec.js` runs the given spec file. Maybe it is time for us to rethink what the expected Cypress workflow should be.

I see the following:

1. User installs Cypress as dev dependency `npm i -D cypress`
2. User writes a spec file `spec.js`
3. User runs Cypress to execute this `spec.js` file with `cypress spec.js`.
   - this opens the Cypress GUI, runs the tests and if there are no errors, closes the GUI
   - if the user wants to run Cypress without GUI, need to use `cypress --headless spec.js`
   - on CI, the headless mode is assumed by default
4. If the user wants to bootstrap `cypress` folder, setup options, etc we need separate command 
`cypress --init`
5. We still have a command to open GUI without running tests `cypress open` just like today.

236453832,Stubbed XHR that are triggered between 2 tests are not stubbed,"## Current behavior:
- In test 1, I stub some routes
- In test 1, I `cy.visit()` my application that triggers some XHR (some stubbed and some not stubbed), I check what I need and I don't wait for all XHR to end
- In test 2, I `cy.visit()` my application, the page is reloaded but *it randomly happens* that some requests triggered by the previous test ""bleed"" in this test

My problem : the XHR that are stubbed in test 1, are not stubbed when bleeding in test 2

## Expected behavior:
Either XHR requests should not bleed in next test or at least they should remain stubbed

## Additional Info (images, notes, stack traces, etc)
When requests are bleeding in another test, it looks like this (test block appears before `before each` block) :
<img width=""503"" alt=""capture d ecran 2017-06-15 a 18 37 33"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7996898/27223658-ac6fb2fa-5291-11e7-8f91-1e9cffc668f3.png"">

Bleeding requests usually are not a problem, since I `cy.visit()` at the beginning of each test, they don't interfere with the test. But some XHR should not reach my server on CI environment, that's why I stub them. When they reach the server on CI, they cause an error `500`, and we configured our CI to make the build fail when there is any error on server. That's why I need them to stay stubbed.

From what I understood of our discussion on gitter with @brian-mann :
 
- it could be a race condition where the XHR is created post teardown, after cypress unrolls all the stubs, but before the page is unloaded (before next `cy.visit`)
- cypress should remove the application entirely before running the end of test teardown (that would prevent any javascript from running, execution would end), then unroll things and prepare for the next test
- enforcing teardown won't work for users that don't `cy.visit` between each test
- cypress should not teardown the app IF its the last test, so you can visually inspect it post test

* Cypress Version: 0.19.2 (app) and 0.13.1 (cli)
* Browser/Browser Version: Chrome 58

### Are you requesting a feature or reporting a bug?
Bug

Our cypress tests started to fail when we bumped react from 15.5.4 to 15.6.1. We debugged the problem and came to the conclusion that `onChange` doesn't fire as it should when the input field is being manipulated using `.type('some text')`.

cli + headless chrome: broken
app + real chrome: broken
user interacting with the browser: working

React component:
```jsx
<input
    className=""input-text""
    onChange={() => {
        // this will executed with react 15.5.4, but not with 15.6.1
    }}
    value={this.props.value}
    type=""text""
    data-stock-url />
```

and this is how we are manipulating it
```javascript
cy.visit('https://...')
    .get('[data-stock-url]').type('https://google.com/stock/123')
```

onChange doesn't fire anymore. The problem went away when we downgraded back to 15.5.4. 

Not sure if related, but [react-dom's CHANGELOG](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) says:
- Fix issues with onChange not firing properly for some inputs. (@jquense in [#8575](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/8575))

* Cypress Version: 0.19.2
* Browser/Browser Version: Electron 53

### Are you requesting a feature or reporting a bug?

Requesting a feature. Please advice a better solution for the following case.

### Case Description:

*Context*

the page is built with react/redux

*Scenario*

Assume there's a form to update current user first name, it has a ""first name"" input box and a submit button.

```
cy
  .get('#first_name'))
    .type(""abcd"")
  .get('#submit')
    .click()
```

*Problem*

the first name received by server is **not stable**, sometimes it is ""abc"" and sometimes it can be ""abcd"".

*Root Cause Analysis*

In the above assumed redux app, an input box change will trigger an action to be dispatched, and be processed by the root reducer to create a new ""page state object"".
If user typing happens really fast, the following scenario can happen:

1. user types abcd, which creates 4 actions, with input value ""a"", ""ab"", ""abc"", ""abcd"" as payload respectively
2. at the time user click on 'submit', the first a few actions has been processed, but the last one action with input value ""abcd"" is still in the queue, so the ""page state object"" still has input value ""abc""
3. the callback of submit get ""current"" input value from ""page state object"", and find it to be ""abc""
ajax call with first name value ""abc"" is sent to the server

*Current Solution*

Current solution I have is to add an additional should assertion on the input box itself, which will ""wait until"" the input box actually renders the exact value we want, which is a signal that the ""page state object"" has already been updated:

```
cy
  .get('#first_name')
    .type('abcd')
    .should('have.value', 'abcd')  // use should to wait until input box actually shows the abcd value
  .get('submit')
    .click()
```

234834274,Provide an option to disable test files preprocessing.,"* Operating System: Mac
* Cypress Version: 0.19.2
* Browser/Browser Version: Chrome 58

### Are you requesting a feature or reporting a bug?
Feature.

### Current behavior:
Cypress preprocesses test JavaScript files (using Babel / Browserify). I'd like to use ClojureScript to write tests, which means using a compiler (based on Google Closure) to obtain a final test JS file. However, Google Closure produces JS files that expect `this` to be set when invoked outside of a function (in the global context). Current Cypress' preprocessing makes `this` `undefined`, which breaks code compiled using Google Closure. I don't know of any obvious workaround for this.

### Expected behavior:
To be able to disable test JS files preprocessing, so that I can use ClojureScript / Google Closure compiler.

### How to reproduce the current behavior:
1. Create a ClojureScript test namespace:

```
(ns st.general)

(js/describe ""General"" (fn []
  (js/it ""Page title"" (fn []
    (js/cy.visit ""http://localhost:80"")
    (.should (js/cy.title) ""equal"" ""Page Title"")))))
```
2. Compile it using ClojureScript compiler to `cypress/integration/test.js`

3. Run this test using Cypress. It will hang for a long time, and eventually produce an error that can be tracked down to `this` being unset.

Currently, all mocked responses need to know the response data upfront.

1) The ability to setup fixture responses dynamically.  Perhaps using some sort of controller function.

Bug 🐛 

### Current behavior:
I have my `baseUrl` set in my `cypress.json` as a locally running server: `http://localhost:2222`. If I click into a project with my project's server running, then kill my project's server, then try to run a test, the GUI says ""Opening Chrome"" with the spinning icon, but Chrome never opens.

### Expected behavior:

- If the server at my `baseUrl` is no longer running when I click to run a test or All tests - I should see an error saying that Cypress could not start. 


### How to reproduce the current behavior:
- Set `baseUrl` in `cypress.json` to a local server.
- Run the server
- Click into the project
- Kill the server
- Click on a test

Frequently (not sure if it's every file), when Cypress auto-generates a file for the user, the files do not include trailing newlines. This is an anti-pattern in general, [see this discussion](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/729692/why-should-text-files-end-with-a-newline), and an added nuisance when using `git`:

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17697/26119976/3b62a76e-3a3d-11e7-9b14-abad4a4f3b76.png)

## Expected behavior:

I expect Cypress to be aware of common idioms and not generate extra work for users.

### How to reproduce the current behavior:

Generate files and see what git says! Might be harder to see in CLI since git doesn't get a chance to complain for new files, normally the complaints happen in diffs. GitHub for Mac shows it clearly, though.

213084423,Capture + Display all logs for everything that happens in Cypress,"### Problem
Many of our users express the desire to see `console.log` statements when running headlessly. Typically you'd be able to see these when you're working in Dev Tools (in headed GUI mode).

We can pretty easily display `console.log` statements by mixing them into `stdout` when running headlessly, but we don't think this is really a ""true"" solution. It's kind of a hack and it still doesn't really tell you ""everything"" that's happening. For instance, when a `console.log` happens, how would you know when it happened in relation to everything else that's going on in a test?

So, we think to **truly** solve this problem, we need a comprehensive way of displaying not just `console.log` statements but also capturing:

- Network Traffic
- Commands
- Retries
- Under the hood Cypress wizardry
- DOM snapshots on failure

By providing **all** of this, the entire picture of what happened during a test is revealed and now you actually have even **more** information at your disposal than even what the GUI headed version provides you.

### Solution
We're going to make these logs available both in our [Dashboard](https://on.cypress.io/dashboard), and in the Desktop App itself.

Once we capture and parse these logs, it will unlock an enormous amount of power in Cypress. We'll also be able to analyze the logs and deliver things like:

- Analytics into your tests
- Comparing a failing test to a previously passing one
- Diffing the logs for changes in response bodies, etc
- Understanding why tests are slow
- Discovering command anti patterns (like explicit waits in your code)

The logs could also be interactive - for instance they should ""sync"" up to the video and enable you to playback everything that actually happened in a Cypress test.

Here is an example comp of what we're going for.

<img width=""1349"" alt=""logs 1"" src=""https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1268976/23758542/2479a79c-04b8-11e7-87c7-7d3313bf5161.png"">

We're still working on communicating the `start` and `end` of logs, and also communicating that a log event acts as ""a stream"" but that events are connected to other events.

For instance when a HTTP request starts - that's a 'start' event. When the response comes back, thats a separate 'end' event. However these are connected and you likely need to be able to view the data for both events from either the `start` or `end` event.

Another example:

A command starts. It retries 65x times. It eventually finishes. The duration of the retry events, the reason its retrying, and the eventual delta between a `start` and an `end` needs to be communicated intelligently.

These log files end up being a massive amount of data, but we already have the infrastructure in place to capture, parse and deliver them. At this point we're just iterating on a UI that's intuitive and doesn't overwhelm the user.

We're going to be providing a new `Logs` tab, but also for individual test failures, we'll just be providing the logs for that one independent test.

204699055,cy.clearCookies should clear *ALL* cookies of all domains,"After extensive R&D we've decided to deviate from the **Webdriver spec** and enhance clearing cookies to include all domains.

By default, Webdriver will only ever clear cookies based on the current domain context. So if you are visiting `http://localhost` and you issue HTTP requests to other domains (which set cookies) - those cookies will not be cleared.

We currently respect this spec, and our own cookie implementations also have this same restriction.

However, this is really just a limitation of Webdriver - and not necessarily something Cypress ever has to abide to. We've built Cypress with cross browser functionality in mind, and any time we deviate from the Webdriver spec, we are forced to ensure we can create compatibility across all other browsers.

Even though we don't support cross browsers *now*, it's a fundamental part of our strategy and we intend to support them down the road.

## What is the proposed change?
- `cy.clearCookies` will clear all cookies on all domains, irrespective of the current browsing context
- Between tests Cypress automatically clears cookies as well, and it will also clear all cookies across all domains.

## How will Cypress be able to consistently clear all cookies?
Cypress's architecture is completely different than that of Webdriver, which puts us in a unique situation to do lots of low level network tricks to pull this off.

While this is subject to change, the way this can be done is by inspecting all of the network traffic that goes through the browser (and therefore Cypress, as we already do), and for all domains, we can manually keep track of all the domains with cookies having been set on them.

At the end of the test, or on a `cy.clearCookies` command, we can then issue multiple HTTP requests out of the browser (through the Cypress driver) to these various endpoints.

Instead of allowing those requests to pass onto the remote server, Cypress will trap the requests, and automatically respond to the requests by issuing a `Set-Cookie` header for each cookie that needs to be cleared by setting the `Max-Age` or `Expires` directive.

The browser will then run its natural course and clear all of the cookies. This will be a bit slower than programatic API's, but will only have to be done when the browser does not expose any kind of automation API to achieve the same result programatically.

196970453,Cypress concatenates cookies on redirects after POST when using `cy.request`.,"Hi @brian-mann ,

In our company we're using `cy.request` for form submission in utility commands in order to speed tests up.
The forms are being submitted correctly but certain cookies are being concatenated at the redirects that happen after a successful POST.
Basically what we need is to create a new user before we run the tests and run the tests using him.
The first step is to login as admin and the second one is to create the user.
After submitting the login data the server sends a 302 status and redirects to the admin home page.
When this happens Cypress concatenates the session cookies (i.e. we see something like this when we inspect the request: `session_dev =R0g0bVlqRVlnNXJkWHQwTzd1bUdERXNSemoyWDlybEVRcVFITVp4YkoyODhaV2F0Z3BBajdiQXhDUkUzTG4vVzBFOWNzdStLa3VMa0NiNDJoeWFzQjdUSUVuSXlrS1QyL1Q0ci9JS0ZsUGY3VGh2L0p6R2JmMGtpblBhQThuZjFZYWtMZHFTOGt6UFpFa2ZrT2pOUXBxMVRuU2J3NUxVY0tyYzR0U0xmOWZ3bTRZNjJZM0gvLzB1d3NQTlZ5ZXZoLS0wUVRTQktHOU53dWJYVHpJNFZOQkxBPT0%3D--4e98ae3094b98b2967dd2b96170ef1a7d1cb247f; session_dev =dFJnQWp3MkYzVGNpVFQ4MnFXcE1MNjRBbFR4UnB5WFFLU0tJT2tWUXFwMXpmMmdxbUUrUWdIWWJSY3oyYmQ4UjNEN3hFU0NEalQ5WnpBdHJCMk9sSHN3NFFFbC9Sc3JVc0FmWGVvRFRKUDJ3dG42L2dEZ3BVQXU0ZytNOS9UWHFUN2J5aWVlbWlOY0hUU0I1V21YOTRUNzl2K1UvMkE0YUU0QnluRzhtWVhzRXNBTnB2TWJaUE1ENkl0anN0c0NnVUFsU2VHNUFFVUpaeDdmMXZBR0NEWlY2Uk9qZ3RZbU1VNk8zVUcxL3B2dTdMc05Vb0M3eitMMS9ubUJtWkZrNjh4b2RNM001S0NiTms1Tnd5d0o1akJhNmVRU3lVZjJ0Tkk4SERpWklxajQ9LS1hRFIzbmJkRXlZSCtHRFpURlpDN1lBPT0%3D--e52508ff7d14831a0331b69c131fe43878e68e6e`
The cookies become invalid and the server redirects to the login page again making it impossible to continue.

We're using a cookies whitelist in order to keep the session cookies.


**Code**
```javascript
Cypress.Cookies.defaults({
  whitelist: [
    'session_dev',
    'session_prod',
  ],
});

Cypress.addParentCommand('submitForm', (options = {}) => {
  const requestOpts = Object.assign({
    method: 'get',
    url: '',
    followRedirect: true,
    form: true,
    body: {},
    headers: {},
  }, options);
  const { url } = requestOpts;

  // First get the auth_token and the form action by visiting the url
  // using a GET request
   cy
    .chain()
    .request(url)
    .its('body')
    .then((body) => {
      const $form = Cypress.$(body).find('form');
      const formAction = $form.attr('action') || url;
      const method = $form.attr('method') || $form.prop('method') || 'get';
      const authToken = $form.find('input[name=""auth_token""]');
      const submitRequestOpts =
        Object.assign({ method: method.toUpperCase() }, requestOpts, {
          url: formAction,
          body: Object.assign(requestOpts.body, {
            auth_token: authToken.val(),
          }),
        });

      cy
        .chain()
        .request(submitRequestOpts);
    });
});

// Utility command for creating a new user
Cypress.addParentCommand('createUser', () => {
  cy
    .clearCookies()
    // login as admin
    .submitForm({
      url: '/login',
      body: {
         email: 'admin@ourcompany.com',
         password: 'password',
      },
    })
    // We're supposed to be logged in here and create a new user
    // Instead the GET request to `/users/new` gets redirected to the login page
    .submitForm({
      url: '/users/new',
      body: {
        email: 'test@test.com',
      },
    });
});

```

Basically the following happens:
- POST to login form
- Receive 302 to admin home page
- Request session cookies from previous requests are concatenated here rendering them invalid 
- Redirect to login page because of invalid cookies


Hopefully I managed to explain the issue.

196160229,Recover from renderer / browser crashes,"Related to #348.

It is actually possible for Cypress to implement strategies when the renderer (or browser process) crashes during a test run - something like `recoverFromRendererCrashes: true` by default.

There is already a mechanism for Cypress to ""reload"" mid-run, rebuild the state of every previous run test, skip over previously run tests, and continue with the next one in line.

In fact this is exactly what `cy.visit` already does under the hood.

We can utilize this same process upon a renderer / browser process crashing to continue on with the run.

So it may look something like this:

```bash
(Running Tests)

✓ test 1 - foo
✓ test 2 - bar
✓ test 3 - baz

Oh noes the renderer process crashed... we will attempt to recover

...Restarting tests at 'test 4 - quux'

✓ test 4 - quux
✓ test 5 - ipsum
```

Taking this a step further, we are starting to see several patterns emerge with how and why renderer processes crash - it is almost always related to extremely long test runs in a memory starved environment (such as Docker).

It may even be a good idea for us to always preemptively ""break up"" headless runs by spec file. 

In other words, we could have an option like `restartBrowserBetweenSpecFiles: true` which would automatically kill the renderer / browser process before moving on to a different spec file (but still rebuild the state of the UI correctly, and still have a single contiguous video recording). 

To the user it would look like nothing is really different, but internally the renderer process would be killed and then restarted.

This would forcefully purge primed memory from the process, which could keep environments like `docker` from ever crashing to begin with.

192683341,Handle dependency failures in Linux when attempting to run Cypress,"Related to #315 and #316 and #457.

There is a longstanding issue with Cypress and it failing to run when there are missing system dependencies in Linux.

The short answer is that the CLI tool automatically ignores `stderr` because Chromium is an unfathomably noisy process and there is no way to tell dependency errors apart from all the normal crap that is logged. This gives the appearance that Cypress just ""hangs"". It's not really hanging, in fact it could not run.

**Workaround**
To check to see if this is happening just invoke the Cypress binary directly after installing:

```bash
## install cypress
cypress install

## invoke binary directly
/home/YOUR_USER/.cypress/Cypress/Cypress
```

If there are dependency errors they will be immediately logged out to you. Just `sudo apt-get install` them.

**Actual Solution**
The solution for this is very do-able, and has been done by other types of applications in our same situation.

1. Whenever we detect that a ""new"" version of Cypress has been installed but has not been run the first time we attempt to launch the application.
2. While we do this, we capture `stderr` and if the output fails then we know the system is missing dependencies.
3. We then display the stored `stderr` which hopefully only displays dependency problems. Alternatively as long as we know what dependencies are required ahead of time for each OS we could list them all out or possibly even figure out whether the system has them installed ahead of time. We could also tell the user exactly what to do, like: `sudo apt-get install dep1 dep2 dep3`
4. Once the application runs on the ""new"" version, we cache this somewhere and don't do this check again (it is quite time consuming).",enhancement

# UPDATES: Oct 20th, 2018

I gave more updates on the work we've been doing for cross browser support and other features on a webinar we gave.

https://youtu.be/FfqD1ExUGlw?t=2079

# UPDATES: Sept 8th, 2018

Cross browser testing is now a front and center major focus here at Cypress. We've been experimenting over the last few months and have a working implementation to add native event support for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and IE11. We also believe adding Mobile Safari and Android should also be straightforward - with Safari actually being the most difficult to get.

The architecture by which we are doing cross browser testing is a best-of-breed design where we tap into the native API's for Chrome and Firefox (avoiding the use of webdriver) and for Edge and IE11 we only use a minimal set of Webdriver API's - none of which are the traditional `sendKeys` or `value` endpoints, which avoids the network latency problem entirely. We plan to eventually publish this architecture so people understand how Cypress is different than Webdriver. None of the other core components of the Cypress architecture are affected by this change, it is simply how to enable native events in a consistent manner across all browsers without introducing the latency / flaky / non-determinism of Webdriver.

In additional to all these things, we are also adding Sauce Labs support (at a minimum) and will also have a proof of concept prepared for that.

As we add support for native events we are subsequently adding support for the browsers at the same time to ensure all of our algorithms are normalized correctly. However, you'll likely first see us release native event support in Chrome + Firefox, followed by IE11 sometime after that.	

...below is the original post from 2016...

## Does Cypress support cross browser testing?

Currently the answer is: **No**

Right now, we only support Chrome* variants such as `Chrome`, `Chromium`, and `Canary`.

## Will you ever support other browsers?

**Yes.**

We will be able to support other Desktop Browsers and Mobile Browsers (using Webviews).

We have built Cypress from day 1 with cross browser testing in mind, and are very conscientious to ensure the API's we write today will work in the future.

# The Technical Details

## Why do you only support Chrome today?

- Cypress taps into the underlying browser Automation API's of Chrome to do things like modify cookies, take screenshots, focusing the browser window, etc.
- We also launch the browser using very specific command line flags to turn off things that get in the way of automated testing.
- We have synchronized these Automation API's when Cypress runs headlessly (in Electron). This means running headlessly behaves identically to a real headed Chrome browser.

## What do you mean by ""Automation API's""?

- Automation API's describe the functions that a browser exposes to do things outside of the **Javascript Sandbox**.
- Currently Cypress comes with its own universal **Driver** which implements most of the `cy` commands using Javascript - in the same run loop as your application. This is superior in the sense that Cypress can understand, know, wait for and modify its behavior based on how your application reacts to its commands in real time.
- The downside is its impossible to fully automate a browser entirely in Javascript. Javascript is a security sandbox which restricts what you can do.
- To fully automate a browser you must extend beyond the sandbox and tap into the underlying Automation API's which do not have these restrictions.

## What will it take to support cross browsers?

- We have to port commands which need to extend outside of the sandbox to each other browser we are attempting to support.

## How will you port these Automation API's?

- Either manually by hand
- Or by using the existing browser drivers

## What do you mean by ""existing browser drivers""?

- Each browser has built its own driver to the [Webdriver Spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/).
- Here are some examples of drivers:
- Google Chrome Driver (ChromeDriver)
- Micosoft Edge Driver
- SafariDriver
- Mozilla GeckoDriver (Firefox)
- Internet Explorer Driver
- Appium

## Why would you port these by hand?

- Because using the existing drivers comes with a host of problems.

## What's wrong with the existing browser drivers?

- They are built for and thus limited to the Webdriver spec.

## What is the Webdriver spec?

- It's a HTTP API spec which defines a common interface to drive all browsers consistently.
- It enables developers to abstract away the details of how each different browser implements its Automation API's

## What is the problem with Webdriver?

- It's slow
- It's async
- It's stateless
- It's exposed over an HTTP server
- It's a lowest common denominator
- It's limited in scope and features
- There are small inconsistencies
- There are various driver bugs

## What do you mean by ""lowest common denominator""?

- The spec is essentially limited to only including ""all the things that every browser can do"".
- This leaves a tremendous amount of *power* and capability off the table that more modern browsers provide.

## Can you give me some examples?

- In Webdriver you cannot clear all cookies for all domains - you can only clear cookies for the current domain context under test.
- There is no way to tell the browser to clear its cache.
- Chromedriver [cannot run tests with Dev Tools open](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/help/devtools-window-keeps-closing).
- Oftentimes the drivers may [miss elements](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/help/clicking-issues) you're trying to interact with.
- You cannot easily control the application under test.
- You don't have native access to `window`, you're limited to stringifying objects over the wire.

## Does Cypress currently use Webdriver?

- No. We wrote our own universal driver.

## What would be the benefit of using Webdriver?

- We could possibly use the existing drivers to port over various commands without having to write the manual integrations by hand.
- This would allow us to support cross browsers much faster.

## If you use Webdriver won't Cypress also inherit these limitations?

- In *most* cases - **no**.
- In *some* cases - **possibly**.

## How can you avoid these limitations?

- By using our universal driver to do as much automation as possible and only go outside of the browser for a limited set of commands.
- The whole point of Cypress is to exceed the boundaries of the current testing ecosystem.
- Because we automate the browser with a completely different architecture we are in a position to extend beyond the Webdriver Spec and also normalize its behavior consistently across all browsers.

## Can you give me an example of this?

- Cypress can [clear all cookies of all domains](../issues/408) instead of just the current domain under test.
- We perform work outside of the browser but then synchronize it seamlessly like with [cy.request](https://on.cypress.io/api/request).
- We have many commands which work outside of the browser which don't need to be ported.

## But won't you still be limited by Webdrivers flakiness?

- No. Even if we were to issue native events through Webdriver, because your application is always tested *through* Cypress, that means Cypress can respond synchronously to events that take place, and modify its behavior accordingly.
- The vast majority of commands do not ever have to leave the browser anyway.

## Can you give me an example of what you're talking about?

- Imagine this scenario: you have a modal opening which animates in, and you want to click the ""Submit"" button.
- In Webdriver, because its an HTTP API which often involves multiple network hops, there is usually a significant delay.
- Let's assume you're attempting to issue a native ""click"" to the submit button.
- When you issue the ""click"" command, the browser driver calculates the center coordinates of the button at say: `{clientX: 50, clientY: 100}`.
- It then issues the native click event with those coordinates.
- By the time your application ""receives"" this event, it could possibly ""miss"" the button altogether.
- Your test fails because your button was never clicked, and the modal was never dismissed.
- What happened?
- Because the modal was animating it, its coordinates were changing rapidly. Webdriver has no idea or concept of this, it only takes a coordinate snapshot at the moment in time and because it asynchronously dispatches the native event, it misses.

## Why isn't this a problem with Cypress?

- Because Cypress is in the same run loop as your application, its impossible for it to ""miss"".
- It can synchrously run calculations, and it already automatically figures out if an element is animating beyond a certain threshold - and therefore wait until it stops.
- If it did issue a native event, it could detect that this event has yet to happen, and if the element moved from the coordinate, immediately attempt to recover by either canceling the click event or issuing another click at new coordinates.

## When do you think you'll support other browsers?

- We really don't know, its not a priority for us right now.

## Why isn't it a priority? This is super important!

- We disagree, cross browser testing is **not as important** as you think it is.

191254083,CypressError: cy.visit() failed trying to load when trying to load pushstate webpack-dev-server URI,"Hi. I've tried searching for an answer to this and I'm not sure it's been covered. Apologies if it has or I'm raising this in the wrong place.

So I have an application that I'm running the tests against which is served by webpack-dev-server. The application itself is a Backbone application using pushstate to remove the # from routes.

The issue arises when using these nested routes e.g. `/my/pushstate/route`

Everything works fine and returns a `200` response for the application in the browser and when curl'ing the URI. `cy.visit()` however returns a `404` when trying to request the same URIs. As a side note `cy.visit()` works correctly when requesting the base URI.

Is there something obvious I'm missing?

I can't share the codebase I'm encountering this but if there's no obvious answers I'll build a mock repo to replicate the issue.

Thanks,
Paul

190597371,Memory leaks when running headlessly due to command log updates after a finished test,"When Cypress runs in headed mode, by default it holds onto snapshot references for the `numTestsKeptInMemory` configuration property. This is the correct behavior.

However in headless mode Cypress forces this value to be `0` since when running headlessly you are typically running all tests, and there is no GUI to interact with.

Cypress automatically takes this into account and will purge the memory references every time a test finishes.

However there is an edge case that can cause it to incorrectly hold onto previous references when command logs are updated - if they are updated after a test ends for a previously run test. In this case, the new references are merged in, and this command log is never cleaned up again, thus creating a memory leak.

The problem is by ""chance"" and chance alone so that's why sometimes long runs would finish without problems and other times they would exhaust from running out of memory. An example of this happening is in our own CI runs here:

There is an inherent restriction in Cypress that a single test can never span across two different *_super domains_. Different subdomains are okay, different superdomains are not.

It's possible such as the case with single-sign-on (SSO) that users may need this behavior. While there are generally always work-arounds in Cypress-land, many users immediately hit this barrier and assume Cypress does not work.

180963569,Convert and consolidate all core-* repos into a Monorepo™,"Cypress is currently spawned across nearly **two dozen repos** and it has become unbearable to keep them all together. We see no real value in publishing separate `core-*` packages to `npm` because they are unusable outside of the Cypress context.

We are going to instead consolidate all of these into one `monorepo` which means we don't have to worry about `npm linking` different repos, different braches, managing different issues, etc.

This will make it much easier for our own development team, and of course works well as part of our larger overall goal and strategy when it comes to open source. We want to make outside contributions as simple and painless as possible.

Here's an in depth summary of the idea:
# Cypress Monorepo
## Why?
- We no longer have to worry about keeping a dozen different repos in sync
- Branching happens and applies to all projects once, its impossible to get out of sync
- No more pulling from a dozen different repos
- No more having 10 tabs open building 10 different projects
- Enables easier setup which makes it easier for developers (external or internal) to contribute
- A single issue tracking repo which avoids the problems of: ""should i open an issue here or in another repo?""
- A single repo where all the stars will go which avoids dilution
- It becomes much easier for the community to track updates and code changes
- Setting dependencies becomes sane. Example: setting branched `driver` and `server` peer dependencies would otherwise be impossible
## Tradeoffs (negative)
- All tests get run in CI in bulk which means a single failure could be in any package
- Bigger / more intimidating repo size
- ? what else ?
## What goes in it?
- Code that is not re-usable in other projects or is not useful to the community in any context outside of Cypress
- Code that in order for it to be updated a new Cypress version would be ‘cut’
- Examples: `https-proxy`, `extension`, `launcher`, `runner`, `reporter`, `desktop-gui`, `electron`, `cli`, `driver`, `server`
## What does not go in it?
- Example: `cypress-adapter-node` does not belong in the monorepo because it can be distributed without causing an update to the desktop application such as bug fixes, enhancements, etc
- Example: `cypress-example-kitchensink` should run in its own CI environment and thus requires a separate repo
- Example: `cypress-plugin-socket-io` can be independently updated and downloaded from within Cypress along with issues open specific to its functionality
- Example: `cypress-api` because its a separate service which can be updated independently and its also private code
- Example: `cypress-releaser` because its a common shared lib used by many independent projects and could be useful outside of just Cypress
## How should code be organized?
- in `cypress/packages/...`
- Each should have a `package.json` + `readme.md`
- Each should be named with `cypress-core-*` since they are part of the core cypress product
## Should documentation go in there?
- No because documentation can be released independently of cypress desktop app
## What about packages which require building?
- There should be a cascading `npm start` command which auto invokes the sub start commands
## What about tests?
- Tests will be written independently in each package but able to be run from a single `npm test` command
- Additionally we should be able to pass a flag to `npm test` which filters the tests and only runs those applicable to a single package. `TEST_ONLY=runner npm test`
- We will store all `e2e` tests (which test comprehensively across all packages) in the root `cypress/spec` directory, but all other tests `unit` and `integration` will go underneath each appropriate package.
## What about distribution?
- We will _NOT_ publish sub packages to npm or version them independently.
- We could either omit the version number or simply bump them all at the same time to the same version.
- There will only be a single master changelog.
## Changes
- rename `cypress-core-icons` to `cypress-icons` since this is reusable outside of `cypress` and can be updated independently without issuing a new version of cypress
- rename `cypress-core-releaser` to `cypress-releaser` for the same reasons above

180754599,A way to disable Cypress global exception handler,"It would be nice to turn off the Cypress global exception handler per test.
For example, we have our own exception handler that sends the errors to the remote crash reporting server. We could write an e2e test to make sure it works as expected. We can
stub the server route and then raise an error in the window's context on purpose.

``` js
cy.window()
        .then(win => {
          function raise () {
            throw new Error(`E2E test error`)

        })

Snapshot pinning would add a button (with a pin icon) to each command, that when clicked, locks the snapshot so that it is not reverted on mouse out and no other snapshots are shown while it is pinned. 

Some requirements:
- A pin button on each command. It should probably only appear on hover
- An indication on the pinned command that it is pinned
- UI over or near the App Under Test, perhaps utilizing the current snapshot message, that indicates that a snapshot is pinned
- UI for unpinning. This should probably be in 2 places:
  - The pin button on the command, which will unpin the snapshot if clicked a 2nd time
  - A universal location, probably near the message mentioned in the previous bullet

The reason this is happening is because the `<a>` subject attempting to be clicked has CSS `display: inline`. 

Display inline causes elements not to displace contents _between_ the text.

When Cypress calculates the elements position to ensure it is not being covered by another element it uses `document.elementFromPoint(x, y)` to return the lowest descendent in the DOM.

If an `inline` element's exact center is calculated to be **between** the text, then this will return the element underneath the target (which is correct).

Unfortunately since Cypress was returned a non-descendent it believes the element is currently being covered and therefore displays the error.

To fix this, Cypress will need to take this situation into account by applying some fallback logic for this specific condition. I'm not sure what it should do yet, perhaps change the CSS to `display: inline-block`, calculate the center coordinates again, and if the element is found, revert to the original CSS and then click the element.

174100082,Implicit should 'exist' assertion is not being applied on cy.get() when other assertion.,"Using `cy.get()` on an element should implicitly assert existence of the element.

``` javascript
cy.visit('https://mydomain.com');
// I am looking for these two XHR requests that are immediately started after my page loads

// Cypress will lose the routes I've defined just before this because I've loaded a whole new page

We need a feature where even if a new page loads, the routes you define are not lost.  This gives testing a more ""natural"" flow.  `cy.visit()` is the equivalent of typing in a browser URL.

155610013,Add support for shadow dom,"Currently, Cypress fails for various reasons when dealing with the shadow dom. So far, I've seen three issues. 

1) Cypress considers the shadow root to be a non-DOM subject.

``` coffeescript
cy.get(""#root"")
  .then ($root) ->
    return Cypress.$($root[0].shadowRoot)
  .find('.child-2')
  .should('have.text', 'I am child 2')
```

![shadow root is non-dom](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1157043/15376011/806ab184-1d20-11e6-9659-9ac7951a63c0.png)

Moving the `.find` into the `.then` gets past this issue, but is not ideal:

``` coffeescript
cy.get(""#root"")
  .then ($root) ->
    return Cypress.$($root[0].shadowRoot).find('.child-2')
  .should('have.text', 'I am child 2')
```

It might be nice and maybe even necessary to have a convenience method like `cy.getShadowRoot()` that could be chained off other dom commands. 

2) When you try to assert something on an element inside a shadow root, Cypress reports that the element is detached from the dom. This stems from the fact that `$.contains(el1, el2)` returns false when el1 is outside the shadow root and el2 is inside it. [Some discussion here](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1784). 

``` coffeescript
cy.get(""#root"")
  .then ($root) ->
    return Cypress.$($root[0].shadowRoot).find('.child-1')
  .should(""have.text"", ""I am child 1"")
```

3) Commands that cause Cypress to check if the subject is hidden by ancestors trigger infinite recursion and blow the call stack because it never hits the `<body>` or `<html>` elements while walking up the chain of ancestors.

``` coffeescript
cy.get(""#root"")
  .then ($root) ->
    return Cypress.$($root[0].shadowRoot).find('.child-2')
  .contains('button', 'Go')
```

154241654,Iframe support,"**Updated Feb 9, 2021 - see note below or https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/136#issuecomment-773765339**

Currently the Test Runner does not support selecting or accessing elements from within an iframe.

## What users want

Users of Cypress need to access elements in an `<iframe>` and additionally access an API to ""switch into"" and switch back out of different iframes. Currently the Test Runner thinks the element has been detached from the DOM (because its `parent` document is not the expected one).

## What we need to do

- Add new `cy` commands to switch into iframes and then also switch back to the ""main"" frame.
- Cypress must inject itself into iframes so things like XHR's work just like the main frame. This will ideally use something like `Mutation Observers` to be notified when new iframes are being pushed into the DOM.

- [ ] Add API to navigate between frames
- [ ] Update the Driver to take into account element document references to known frames

## Things to consider

- How will we handle snapshotting? Currently we don't take snapshots for anything inside of an `<iframe>`.
- How will we handle cross origin frames? It's possible to enable these with `{ chromeWebSecurity: false }` (Chromium-based browsers only).
- How will we show context switching in the Command Log? It should probably look / be colored differently than the 'normal' main commands

## Examples of how we could do this

```js
// switch to an iframe subject
cy
  .get('#iframe-foo').switchToIframe() 
  .get('#button').click() // executed in <iframe id='iframe-foo' />

// or pass in $iframe object in hand
cy
  .get('#iframe-foo').then(($iframe) => {
    cy.switchToIframe($iframe)
    cy.get('#button').click()
  })

// now switch back to the main frame
cy
  .switchToMain()
  .get(':checkbox').check() // issued on the main frame
```

## Workaround

It's possible to run `cy.*` commands on iframe elements like below:

```js
cy.get('iframe')
  .then(($iframe) => {
    const $body = $iframe.contents().find('body')

    cy.wrap($body)
      .find('input')
      .type('fake@email.com')
})
```

## ⚠️ Updates

**Updates as of Feb 9, 2021**

Pasting some snippets from our technical brief on iframe support that we are currently planning. As always, things can change as we move forward with implementation, but this is what we are currently planning.

If there's any feedback/criticism on these specific proposed APIs, we'd be happy to hear it.

### .switchToFrame([...args], callback)

Switches into an iframe and evals callback in the iframe. Doesn’t matter whether the iframe is same-origin or cross-origin.

#### Stripe payment example

```js
// ❗️ This is planned work and does not currently work
cy.visit('someshop.com')
// ... add stuff to cart
// ... get to payment page
cy.get('iframe').switchToFrame(() => {
  cy.get('#name').type('name')
  cy.get('#number').type('1234-5678...')
  cy.contains('Pay').click()
})
// go on with cypress commands in the main frame
cy.contains('Thanks for your order')
```

#### Same-origin iframe

Example where a site uses a same-domain iframe as a date-picker widget

```js
// ❗️ This is planned work and does not currently work
cy.visit('https://date-picker.com')
cy.get('iframe').switchToFrame(() => {
  cy.get('.next-month').click()
  cy.contains('24').click()
})
// switch out of iframe context because callback is finished
cy.get('.date').should('have.text', '2/24/2021')
```

We also intend to support [snapshots of iframes](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1433).

Right now I have to rely on an API to be available use cy.request to hit an endpoint to perform the actions I need. However, we do have some functionality that can only be done through the CLI and it would be nice to have access to that through Cypress.
### Suggestion

It would be nice to be able to run a CLI command from Cypress, e.g. with `cy.spawn`.

An example usage could be to ssh into a host and kill a certain process. It could look something like this:

``` js
cy.spawn('ssh {host_ip}', 'kill -9 {process_id}');
```

I'm not sure that's the best API, but this is just to give an idea of what I am looking for.

## Cypress team edit

This feature will work seamlessly once [Full network stubbing](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/687) is implemented.

### Workarounds

- use experimental fetch polyfill available in [v4.9.0](https://on.cypress.io/changelog#4-9-0)

or do it yourself:

- delete `window.fetch` before visiting the page to force your application to polyfill it on top of XHR. If the application does not include a polyfill, you can load one from your tests.
- stub `window.fetch` directly in JavaScript

One of the elements will be removed from the DOM (my expected behavior). I wanted to ensure that the remaining element did not have class `empty`.

67270942,cy.server() should work even before cy.visit(),"Currently `cy.server` can only be started after you `cy.visit` a remote page.

```
cy
  .visit(""http://localhost:7000/dashboard"")
  .server()
  .route(...)

This is problematic because many pages make XHR requests `onLoad`.  Because `cy.visit` resolves when the page's `load` event fires, by this time it is often too late.  XHR requests may have gone out.

Therefore `cy.server` should be able to be invoked prior to a page loading (even though one does not exist).

Any `routes` attached to the server should also be carried over.

- Allow for option of `autoRespond: false` to be passed into `cy.route()`
- Have a way to tell the route to respond at a later point in the test.
- Allow for a specific delay time before auto responding (allow this is probably a separate issue)
